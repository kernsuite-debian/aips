    This directory contains the source files for the AIPS screen
servers for SunView and the X Window System.  The source files are
stored as self-extracting shell archives with the extension .SHR.
This form of distribution is intended to simplify the installation of
these servers on systems that do not have AIPS.  The shell archives
are created using the Unix Bourne shell script AIPSSHAR found in this
directory.

    To install one of the servers first identify the relevant archive
file (or files) from the list below.  Copy this file to the directory
in which you wish to build the server.  If you are installing the
server on a Unix system or any other system that has a Bourne shell
available you can unpack the archive by executing it within the shell.
On a Unix system you may type

    sh <archive>.SHR

or

    chmod +x <archive>.SHR
    <archive>.SHR

    If you do not have a Bourne (or compatible) shell available then
copy the FORTRAN program UNSHR.FOR from this directory to your
machine.  Rename the source file according to the conventions for
FORTRAN programs on your machine and compile and link it.  UNSHR is a
standalone program and is written in strict ANSI FORTRAN 77.  You may
then unpack the archives using UNSHR.  For example, on a VAX/VMS
system, you might type

    FORTRAN UNSHR
    LINK UNSHR
    RUN UNSHR
    Enter name of archive:             (UNSHR prompts for input)
    <archive>.SHR

Note that UNSHR requires the extension (.SHR) to be given explicitly
and that the input file name is case sensitive if your operating
system has case sensitive file names.  Also not that UNSHR will only
operate on AIPS shell archives generated with AIPSSHAR; it will not
handle other forms of Unix shell archive.

    In the unlikely event that you are trying to install a server on a
machine that has neither a Bourne shell nor a FORTRAN compiler you
can, as a last resort, pick the .SHR file apart using an editor.
Decoding the format of the archive (which is fairly trivial) is left
as an exercise.

    Once you have unpacked the archive you may delete the .SHR file.
Note that each archive contains a file named INSTALL.ME that contains
specific instructions for building that particular server.

    Finally, note that if you need to extract files from more than one
archive file you should unpack the archives in separate directories to
avoid files being overwritten in the event of a name clash.
