The only unusual (i.e. not defined by AIPS) subroutine here is YLEXSUB.
This is the Lexidata subroutine library as defined by Haystack for a UNIX
based Lexidata.  It attempts to emulate the Lexidata VAX callable library
as supported by Lexidata.  There is one significant addition to these subroutines;
the reopen command 'dsreop_( fp)'.  This takes a file descriptor and passes it
to the Lexidata library (see YTVOPN).

Due to the problem with the Lexidata trackball (cannot assign it to a cursor),
there are two temporary files YCRCTL and YCURSE which read the keyboard for
cursor motion.  If and when the trackball IOP is cured, the routines marked
YCRCTL2 and YCURSE2 should be placed in YCRCTL and YCURSE, respectively.
