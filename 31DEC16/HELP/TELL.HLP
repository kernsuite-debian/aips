TELL      LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
TELL:  Verb to send parameters to a task from AIPS in execution
OPTELL                             TELL operation code
TASK                               Task name
NUMTELL         0.0        35.0    AIPS number of running task
VERSION
                                   Version of task desired.
          Task name may be inserted as an immediate argument
          i.e TELL TASK or TELL 'TASK'
----------------------------------------------------------------
TELL
Type: Pseudoverb
Use:  Sends selected parameters to those tasks that know how to
      use this option.  Use SHOW TASK to review these
      parameters.  TELL works by putting the parameters in a
      file.  At some later time, the task reads this file and
      acts on the request.
Adverbs:
  OPTELL...Nature of the operation:
              'ABOR'  Die now, reset file statuses and delete
                      outputs.
              'QUIT'  Die now, but save the current output
                      results.
              'CHAN'  Change the running parameters.
  TASK.....Requested task name (5 characters or less).
  NUMTELL..AIPS number of the task to be "told" - this allows
           you to tell batch jobs to terminate gracefully.
           0 => current AIPS number.
  DOWAIT...Logical adverb.  True (> 0) specifies that AIPS
           not resume until the requested task has finished.
  VERSION..Desired version of the task, i.e. 'NEW', 'OLD'.  See
           HELP VERSION for details.

Grammar:          TELL      or      TELL taskname
            The first TELLs the task referred to by the
            adverb TASK.  The second TELLs the task 'taskname'.
Examples:   TASK='CNTR'; TELL            TELLs the task CNTR
            TELL PRTPL                   TELLs the task PRTPL.
            Note that the adverb TASK is not set to 'PRTPL' in
            the second example.

Tasks which support this capability:
  MX........Makes and deconvolves images with B. G. Clark CLEAN
            method.  Can change DOTV, NITER, beam, and other
            parameters.
  APCLN.....Deconvolves images with B. G. Clark CLEAN method.
            Can change DOTV, NITER, beam, and other parameters.
  SDCLN.....Deconvolves images with CLEAN followed by SDI
            methods.  Can change DOTV, NITER, beam, and other
            parameters.
  VTESS.....Deconvolves multiple images with maximum entropy
            methods.  Can change DOTV, NITER, other parameters.
  UTESS.....Deconvolves multiple images with maximum entropy
            methods - for images of polarization.  Can change
            DOTV, NITER, other parameters.
  VM........Deconvolves multiple images with maximum entropy
            methods.  Can change DOTV, NITER, other parameters.
  ASCAL.....Self-calibration.  Can change the diagnostic print
            level.
Tasks which support QUIT or ABOR operations only:
  CNTR......Makes contour drawing plot files.
  GREYS.....Makes grey-scale plus contour plot files.
  PCNTR.....Makes contour plus polarization vector plot files.
  QMSPL.....Plots a plot file on a QMS laser printer.
  MCUBE.....Builds n+1 (or n) dimensional images from sets of
            n-dimensional images.
