TVGUESS
Type: Verb
Use:  Plot the curve described by the initial guess of the Gaussian
      components for a slice model.  TVGUESS erases the specified
      graphics plane, plots the model described by the adverbs and
      labels the plot.  TVAGUESS plots the model without erasure and
      labeling.

      Usage hint:  Start with a TVINIT to clear the TV memory.  Then
      do a TVSLICE to one graphics plane, TVGUESS or TVAGUESS to a
      different graphics plane.  This allows the two to be seen but in
      different colors to aid recognition.  When the plots overlap
      a complementary color is used.  The guess may be replaced
      without a new TVSLICE by either a new TVGUESS or a GRCLEAR;
      TVAGUESS with GRCHAN set for the guess graphics plane.  GROFF
      will make one part of the display invisible without deleting it.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name (name).         Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name (class).        Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name (seq. #).       0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk unit #.               0 => any.
  INVERS......Version # of SL file.      0 => highest version #
  LTYPE.......Labelling type, see HELP LTYPE for details:
              1 = border, 2 = no ticks, 3 or 7 = standard, 4 or 8 =
              relative to ref. pixel, 5 or 9 = relative to subimage
              (BLC, TRC) center, 6 or 10 = pixels.  7-10 all labels
              other than tick numbers and axis type are omitted.
              Add n * 100 to alter the metric scaling.
  PIXRANGE....Min,Max of Image intensity.  0 => entire range of
              the slice (not the image).
  BDROP.......No of slice pts to omit from beginning of plot.
  EDROP.......No of slice points to omit from end of plot.
              Note that these are points in the slice not pixels in
              the original image.  Use INEXT='SL'; EXTLIST to see how
              many points are in the slice.
  GRCHAN......TV graphics plane to use.  <= 0 -> 1
  NGAUSS......No of gaussian components.
  GMAX........Initial guess of maximum amplitudes.
  GPOS........Initial guess of positions of the components in
              GPOS(1,i).  GPOS(2,i) not used.
  GWIDTH......Initial guess of widths at 1/2 max amplitude in
              GWIDTH(1,i).  GWIDTH(2,i) and GWIDTH(3,i) are not used.
              Note that the units of GMAX, GPOS, and GWIDTH are those
              in the plot (e.g. mJy, arc sec or Jy, degrees or ??).
