UVSEN
Type: Task
Use:  UVSEN is intended to determine the rms sidelobe level (for
      large field of view) for various tapers, and the
      brightness sensitivity for gaussians of various sizes, for
      a given observation. Natural weighting is assumed and
      both the RR and LL correlations are assumed present.
      Input is a visibility data base (UV file), the sizes of
      the gaussian to use.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Vis name(name).         Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Vis name(class).        Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Vis name(seq. #).       0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk drive # of vis.    0 => any.
  APARM.......APARM(1) - start gaussian taper in arcsec
              APARM(2) - end gaussian taper in arcsec
              APARM(3) - increment, in arcsec.
              APARM(4) - Rms noise/sample, in Jy.
                 Default 20 mJy.
