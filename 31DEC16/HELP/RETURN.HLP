RETURN    LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
----------------------------------------------------------------
RETURN
Type:  Verb
Use:   To allow the present procedure to be called by other
       procedures and, optionally, to return values (as in a
       function subroutine).
Grammar:    RETURN
       returns no value but allows nested procedures.
            RETURN   adverb/expression
       returns the value of the adverb or the result of the
       expression.  These values may be scalars, real arrays,
       or character string arrays.  This verb may be used only
       while typing or editing a procedure.
Example:    RETURN   I
       in PROC DUMT would be called as, e.g. CHAN = DUMPT.
            RETURN   'FINISHED'
       in PROC NAMD would be called as, e.g. STRA2 = NAMD(3).
       If a RETURN is not given in a procedure, then the
       procedure should never be referenced from within
       another procedure.
