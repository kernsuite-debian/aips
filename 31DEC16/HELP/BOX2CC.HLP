BOX2CC:  Procedure to convert CLBOX (pixels) to CCBOX (arc sec)
                   Use RUN BOX2CC first
INNAME                             Image file name (name)
INCLASS                            Image file name (class)
INSEQ              0.0      9999.0 Image file name (seq. #)

BOX2CC
Procedure:  This procedure is designed to simplify filling in CCBOX
       for task CCEDT.  It converts NBOXES rectangular boxes in CLBOX
       in pixels into NCCBOX boxes in CLBOX in arc seconds.  Do not
       use circular boxes.  The CLBOX values may be set with AIPS TV
       verbs, particularly TVBOX and REBOX.

          Before attempting to use BOX2CC, the RUN file BOX2CC must be
       run to define the procedure.  This is done by:
       >RUN BOX2CC
       and only needs to be done once.
Adverbs:
  INNAME.....Input UV file name (name).    Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....Input UV file name (class).   Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......Input UV file name (seq. #).  0 -> highest.
  INDISK.....Disk drive # of input UV file.  0 -> any.
  NBOXES.....Number of Clean boxes in CLBOX
  CLBOX......Clean box pixel coordinates: (4,50) array gixes Xmin,
             Ymin, Xmax, Ymax for each of up to 50 boxes.  Note that
             CLBOX can only take the first 10.
Output adverbs:
  NCCBOX.....Number of CLBOX entries.
  CLBOX......Clean boxes in arc seconds wrt the reference pixel.
