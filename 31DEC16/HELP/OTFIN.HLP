OTFIN:  Task to read 12-m OTF data to index its contents
DATAIN
                                   Input data file (sdd file)
BCOUNT            0.0              First included position
ECOUNT            0.0              Last included position
BIF               0.0              IF number 0 => all
DOCRT            -3.0     132.0    > 0 -> use the terminal,
                                   else use the line printer
                                   > 72 => terminal width
OUTPRINT
                                   Printer disk file to save

OTFIN
Type: Task
Use:  Reads a single 12m OTF map to determine its contents.  This task
      will assist in preparing inputs to OTFUV, the task which
      translates the 12-meter telescope "on-the-fly" spectral-line data
      into AIPS format.
Adverbs:
  DATAIN......Input 12m sdd file (raw data file).
  BCOUNT......First scan in OTF map which you want to display. 0 => all
  ECOUNT......Last scan in OTF map which you want to display.  0 => all
  BIF.........IF number to display.  0 => all
  DOCRT......False (<= 0) use the line printer if OUTPRINT = ' '
                   else write named OUTPRINT file only.
                   When OUTPRINT is not blank, DOCRT=-2 suppresses the
                   page-feed character on page headers and DOCRT=-3
                   suppresses page headers and most other header
                   information.
             True  (> 0) use the terminal interactively.  The task will
                   use the actual terminal width as a display limit
                   unless 72 < DOCRT < width.  In that case, the display
                   limit will be DOCRT characters.
              OTFIN uses 4 different formats depending on the width.
              If DOCRT > 114, one line/scan is used and if DOCRT > 128 a
              more open format is used.  DOCRT >= 80 gives a somewhat
              better 2-line format than the one used for 72-character
              wide terminals.  "Wider is better"
  OUTPRINT....Disk file name in which to save the line printer output.
              ' ' => use scratch and print immediately for interactive
              jobs - batch jobs use OUTPRINT = 'PRTFIL:BATCHjjj.nnn'
              (jjj = job #, nnn = user #).  When OUTPRINT is not blank,
              multiple outputs are concatenated, and the file is not
              actually printed.
