TKERASE:  Verb to erase the TEK graphics screen
                      No inputs
----------------------------------------------------------------
TKERASE
Type: verb
Use:  Erases the TEK graphics screen.  With large plots displayed in
      TEK emulation windows, the replot forced on window expose events
      can be painfully slow.  This allows the screen to be erased so
      that redraws are instantaneous.
Adverbs: none.
