IMWEDGE   LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
IMWEDGE:  Verb to load a step wedge of image intensities as
          previously loaded (shows full range of map values.)
              No inputs
              Optional immediate argument gives width of wedge
                 in pixels (default 16).  If argument < 0,
                 program uses TV cursor to determine where to
                 put wedge (default below bottom or above top
                 of image).
              Uses TV cursor to select the image with which
                 the wedge is associated (if needed).

IMWEDGE
Type:  Verb
Use:   To load a linear wedge into a TV memory plane using the
       same transfer function and clipping used in loading the
       associated image.  IMWEDGE constructs the wedge with
       intensities from map min to map max.  If there is more
       than one image on the TV, the routine asks the user to
       point out the image with which the wedge is to be
       associated.  There is an optional imediate argument:
               IMWEDGE (n)
       If n is missing, use n=16, where n is the width of the
       wedge in pixels.  If n<0 use abs(n) as the width of the
       wedge and ask the user to indicate where to draw the
       wedge.  The default locations of the wedge are:
       (a) If there is only one image visible, far enough below
       or above the image to allow for complete labeling, (b)
       just below the image (if it will fit), (c) above the
       image (if it will fit), and (d) overlaying the bottom
       rows of the image.
Adverbs:     None
