UNCAL     Task to set up tables for uncalibrating AT data
INNAME                             Input UV file name (name)
INCLASS                            Input UV file name (class)
INSEQ             0.0     9999.0   Input UV file name (seq. #)
INDISK            0.0        9.0   Input UV file disk unit #
INEXT                              2 character code to determine
                                   which table is to be copied.
                                   Valid values = 'CU' or 'BU',
                                   '  ' = 'CU'
INVER                              Version of input table to use

UNCAL
Task: To take the CU and BU tables generated at the Australia
      Telescope and turn them into CL and BP tables. This is
      done because the CU and BP tables contain the inverse of
      the corrections applied on-line and therefore to undo the
      on-line calibration the user just applies the CL and BP
      tables generated by UNCAL.  Effectively, all that UNCAL
      does is rename the '*U' tables to either CL or BP tables.
  INNAME.....Input UV file name (name).      Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....Input UV file name (class).     Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......Input UV file name (seq. #).    0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk drive # of input UV file.  0 => any.
  INEXT......2 character code specifiying which table is to be
             copied. 'CU' will copy a 'CU' table to a 'CL' table
             'BU' will generate a 'BP' table. '  ' => 'CU'
  INVER......Version number of the specified input table to use.
