PLVER           0.0     46655.0    Version # of PL file. 0=>high
ASPMM           0.0                Arc sec per mm. 0=>self scale
                                   Scale factor for some types
                                   of plots (see HELPs)

DOCENTER       -1.0         1.0    Center on page?  > 0 = yes
                                   -1->length can overlap fold

PRTPL
Type: Task
Use:  PRTPL will find an extension file of type PL and use the
      graphics commands in that file to build a bit map.  The
      graph described by the bit map will then be written to
      the the dot-matrix plotter (often also the printer).
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name(name).          Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name(class).         Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name(seq. #).        0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk drive # of image.     0 => any.
  PLVER.......Version # of the PL file.  0 => largest version #
  ASPMM.......Scaling factor with 0 => self scale.  For CNTR,
              PCNTR, and GREYS plots with related position
              axes, ASPMM is the requested arc sec / mm on the
              output plot.  For all other plots, it is a
              scale reduction factor (0 < ASPMM < 1). Note:
              grey scales will round down to nearest integer
              plotter dots per pixel and one cannot request
              a plot to overfill the paper.
  COPIES......Number of copies of the plot.  0 => 1.
  DOCENTER....Center the image on the page?  > 0 -> yes.  <= 0
              -> will allow the plot to extend beyond the fold
              in the paper.  If ASPMM is set so the plot
              extends beyond the paper width, it is set to fit.
  DOINVERS....White contour on black page?  <= 0 -> no.
  BADDISK.....Numbers of the disks which should not be used for
              the plot scratch file.
