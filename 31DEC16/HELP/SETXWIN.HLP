SETXWIN:  Procedure to set BLC and TRC with TV cursor

          There are 2 immediate arguments: the width of the
          window in X and in Y.  The cursor is used to point
          at the center of the desired window.
          Thus SETXWIN (45, 66) will specify a window of
          45 X pixels and 66 Y pixels centered on the cursor.

          There are no input adverbs.
         @     Output adverbs:
BLC      @         0.0     16384.0 Bottom left corner
TRC      @         0.0     16384.0 Top right corner
PIXXY    @         0.0     16384.0 Map pixel position: center
DELTAX   @         0.0     16384.0 X width in pixels
DELTAY   @         0.0     16384.0 Y width in pixels
----------------------------------------------------------------
SETXWIN
Type:  Procedure
Use :  To set window adverbs BLC and TRC by giving the widths
       of the window (in pixels) as immediate arguments and by
       pointing at the center of the window with the TV cursor
       pressing any button.
Arguments: Width in X, width in Y in pixels.
       i.e. SETXWIN (200, 55) will set a window 200 pixels in
       X by 55 pixels in Y.
Adverbs:  There are no input adverbs.  The following adverbs
       have their values changed by the procedure.
  BLC........Bottom left corner of window
  TRC........Top right corner of window
  PIXXY......Map pixel position at center of window.
  DELTAX.....Width in X pixels
  DELTAY.....Width in Y pixels
