PHASPRM
Type: Adverb (Array(30))
Use:  Phase data by antenna number.
Task:
  SNCOR.....Applies user-selected corrections to the calibration SN
            table.  PHASPRM is used in transferring phases between
            frequencies with scaling to compensate for ionospheric
            delays - it gives the phases for 28 antennas and the 2
            frequencies.
