TVMBLINK: Verb which blinks 2 TV planes either auto or manually
TVCHAN          0.0        16.0    1st TV channel
TV2CHAN         0.0        16.0    2nd TV channel

            switches between images, button B selects auto
            blinking, button C selects enhance both images, and
            button D exits.
          In enhancement mode:
            Cursor X gives intercept, cursor Y gives slope, and
            button C reverses sign of slope.  Buttons A and B

TVMBLINK
Type:  Verb
Use:   To compare images on 2 planes of the TV by blinking them.
       While auto-blinking: the cursor X position controls the blink
       rate and cursor Y position controls the proportion of time
       spent on each plane.  In auto or manual blink modes: button A
       selects manual mode and the next channel, button C selects
       auto-blinking, button B selects image enhancement of both
       images together,  and button D causes the verb to exit.  During
       the image enhancement, the left hand half of channel A appears
       with the right hand half of channel B on the TV screen.  In
       this mode, the cursor X position controls the intercept and the
       cursor Y position controls the slope of the (linear) transfer
       function.  Buttons A and B may be used to select channels A and
       B, resp., for individual enhancement.  Button C will switch the
       sign of the slope and Button D will return the verb to the
       blinking mode.
Adverbs:
  TVCHAN.....Selects TV channel to be "channel A"
  TV2CHAN....Selects TV channel to be "channel B"
             If either are out of range, 1 and 2 are used.  On TVs
             which support split screen, channel A will appear on the
             left (or top) half during enhancement functions.
