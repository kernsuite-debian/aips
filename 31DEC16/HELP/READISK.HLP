READISK
Type: Procedure
Use:  READISK reads FITS files from disk, looping through many files
      if instructed.  The files must have a standard name
                     (DISK##C####)
      which is the name produced when files are written out with
      WRTDISK.  This procedure cannot be used unless the file(s) have
      names with this format.  READISK uses FITLD (see HELP FITLD
      for details).  Remember to load this procedure typing RUN
      WRTPROCS before trying to run it (by typing READISK).

      This procedure can transfer data across the Internet if needed.

      Warning: this procedure runs with DOWAIT FALSE.  This allows it
      to continue even if some of the files are missing - which will
      occur if the WRTDISK found empty catalog slots.  However, the
      procedure will also continue to run in the presence of a real
      error.
Adverbs:
  OLDVOL.....The DISK # in the file's name, i.e. the number after
             "DISK" in the file name.  The is the INDISK used in
             WRITDISK.
  DATAIN.....The name of a directory from which to read files.  The
             name is limited to 48-characters and must be in the form
                  <logical>
             or
                  <node>::<logical>
             where <node> is the remote computer name, <logical> is
             the environment variable (logical name) for the disk
             area in which the file.  <node> is usually omitted when
             the file is local to the current computer.  TPMON1 must
             be running of the computer names in <node>.
  NFILES.....The first number of the file to be loaded, i.e. the
             number after the "C" in the name of the first file
             to be loaded. 0 => 1
  NCOUNT.....The last number of the file to be loaded, i.e. the
             number after the "C" in the name of the last file
             to be loaded. 0 => number in NFILES
  OUTDISK....The disk drive #.  0 => highest with space
  DOUVCOMP...If true (DOUVCOMP > 0) the output data is written in
             compressed format which can result in a substantial
             reduction in disk space with some loss of weighting
             information.  Only used for FITS UV files

READISK:            Procedure to run FITLD to read files from disk
                    that have standard format names.  These file
                    names are the format WRTDISK uses to write out
                    files.
Documenter:         Amy Mioduszewski
Related Programs:   FITLD, WRTDISK, WRTPROCS

To load the procedure type RUN WRTPROCS.  This must be done before
running the procedure (by typing READISK).

READISK will read a file from disk (with FITLD) that has a standard
format file name.  This standard format is DISKddCcccc, where the dd
and the cccc are numbers.  The dd is specified in the OLDVOL input and
the cccc is specified by NFILES and NCOUNT.  If NFILES and NCOUNT are
different then the numbers NFILES through NCOUNT are read.


Example:

If you want to read in files:
DISK01C0098
DISK01C0090
DISK01C0100
DISK01C0101
which are on disk $FITS

Set:
OLDVOL 1
DATAIN 'FITS'
NFILES 98
NCOUNT 101

Note that the OLDVOL adverb will not be knowen until you have
       RUN WRTPROCS
