CLBOX
Type: Adverb   (Real(4,50))
Use:  An array containing 50 sets of of four numbers that are
      normally used to specify areas within which model
      sources may be found (e.g. point sources found by Clean).
      The number of such areas is normally given by the value
      of the NBOXES adverb.

      All tasks that use the CLBOX adverb support the definition
      of rectangular areas in which the four numbers are the
      x and y pixel coordinates of the bottom-left corner
      followed by the x and y coordinates of the top-right
      corner in pixels.  IMAGR, SCMAP and WFCLN also support
      the definition of circular areas by setting: a circular
      area is specified by setting the first number to -1, the
      second to the radius of the circle on pixels and the third
      and fourth to the x and y pixel coordinates of the centre.
Null value:   0
      Null value assignment varies with the verb or task.
