CCFND
Type:  Task
Use:   CCFND prints on the line printer or terminal the rows of
       extension files containing clean components in the
       tables format.  CCFND gives a running total of the flux
       and tells the number of first negative component.  For
       gaussian models "type" GAUS means the deconvolved
       gaussian and CGAU means the size of the source convolved
       with the instrumental response.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name (name).           Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name (class).          Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name (seq. #).         0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk drive # of image.       0 => any.
  INVERS......Extension file version #     0 => highest.
  ECOUNT......Last component to examine.
  FLUX........Flux density limit for CC for first pass
  FACTOR......Factor to Multiply Negative flux in second pass

CCFND:  Task to find Clean Components in a CC table
DOCUMENTOR: W. Cotton
RELATED PROGRAMS: APCLN, MX, IMFIT, UVFIT

                          PURPOSE

     CCFND is to list the contents of Clean component files in
a useable form.  Both CLEAN point components and extented model
components may be contained in the table.  CCFND needs little
explanation except for how to obtain proper scaling of sizes
and positions for model files associated with uv data files.

>INDISK=2; GETN(23); IMHEAD
>KEYWORD='CDELT4'; KEYVALUE=1.0 / 3600., 0.
>PUTHEAD; IMHEAD

     KEYWORD='CDELT4' indicates the increment on the fourth
axis.  Angle like values are stored in the header as degrees so
KEYVALUE=1.0/3600.0,0 sets the first word of KEYVALUE to 1
second in degrees and 0 in the second word.  The axis order can
be determined by IMHEAD or QMHEAD.  After using PUTHEAD, IMHEAD
or QMHEAD should be used to verify that the desired results
were obtained.  These verbs will give the RA and Dec increments
in arcseconds.
