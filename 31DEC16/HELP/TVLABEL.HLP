                                   2 no ticks, 3 standard, 4 rel

DOCIRCLE       -1.0         1.0    > 0 => extend ticks to form
                                   coordinate grid

TVLABEL
Type: Verb
Use:  TVLABEL will label an image on the TV.  If there is more than
      one image (of a map) visible on the TV, the routine will ask the
      user to position the cursor on any part of the image he wishes
      labeled and then to press any button.  The coordinates, but not
      the labels, will appear on top of the image if there is not
      enough room on the outside.  Wedges may be labeled with
      TVWLABEL, not TVLABEL.
Adverbs:
  GRCHAN......Graphics channel to use for the lettering.  Graphics
              channel 8 is used for a black background.  Unless
              changed by GWRIT or the .Xdefaults file (see HELP XAS),
              the normal color for channel 1 is yellow, 2 the
              previously familiar green, 3 pink, 4 cyan, 5 reddish, 6
              dark blue, 7 orange.  0 -> 2.
  LTYPE.......Labelling type, see HELP LTYPE for details:
              1 = border, 2 = no ticks, 3 or 7 = standard, 4 or 8 =
              relative to ref. pixel, 5 or 9 = relative to subimage
              (BLC, TRC) center, 6 or 10 = pixels.  7-10 all labels
              other than tick numbers and axis type are omitted.
              Add n * 100 to alter the metric scaling.
  DOCIRCLE....False (<= 0) means that tick marks are short lines
              extending inward from the plot borders.  True (>0)
              requests that a full coordinate grid be drawn.
