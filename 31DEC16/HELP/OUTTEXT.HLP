OUTTEXT
Type: Adverb  (String*48)
Use:  To specify the name of some disk file outside the usual AIPS
      catalog system to be used as output from an AIPS verb or task.
      The file can be a text file giving a basic data listings of
      various sorts.

Format: The name is usually given by specifying a logical device plus
      directory, followed by a colon, followed by the actual file
      name.  In Unix, logicals are environment variables.  The
      logical name must be set up before entering the AIPS program
      and is usually in upper case.  Thus, for example:
             % setenv MYAREA ~joeuser
      for the C shell, and
             $ myarea=$HOME; export MYAREA
      for bourne, korn, and bash shells.  Then in AIPS,
             OUTTEXT = 'MYAREA:FITS.DAT'
      Note that the Unix-standard $ ahead of the logical is omitted.
      AIPS-standard logicals like FITS (often AIPS/FITS) are available
      also.  Other forms are now acceptable as well:
             OUTTEXT = 'FITS.DAT
      will find the file in the $FITS directory (when reading or
      writing FITS disk files) or in the directory local when you
      started AIPS.  A full path name may also be given
             OUTTEXT = '/home/primate2/egreisen/AIPS/Text.prt
      if it fits in 48 characters.  Note that the trailing quote mark
      is left off and this is the last command on the input line so
      that the case is preserved.

      In some programs, it is regarded as an error if OUTTEXT already
      exists.  Most concatenate to or replace pre-existing OUTTEXTs.

Null value:  '          '
      Taken to mean no subsidiary file.  This can be an error.
