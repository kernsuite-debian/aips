OFMGET
Type:     Verb
Use:      Load the TV's OFMs from an OFM save file.  If no disk
          logical name is given in OFMFILE (or the immediate
          argument), minimum match is used to select the full
          file name from the OFM files belonging to the user and
          to the system.  If some other area is used, the full
          name (including extension) must be specified.

          There is a web site
                 http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~sawada/aipscb/
          with color images of all standard AIPS OFMFILEs.
          Verb OFMDIR will show available OFMFILEs.
Adverbs:
  COLORS......=0 -> change all colors of the OFM to the contents of
                    OFMFILE
              <0 -> change abs(COLORS) color to the contents of
                    OFMFILE and zero the other 2 colors
              >0 -> change COLORS color to the contents of OFMFILE and
                    leave the other 2 colors as they are
              COLORS = 1,2,3 for red,green,blue respectively.
  OFMFILE.....Specifies the name of the file located in the area
              known by the logical (environment) variable OFMFIL
              (your saved OFMs) or AIPSOFM (system-provided
              OFMs), or located in any other area, if that
              area's logical name is specified as
                    OFMFILE = '<logical>:<fullname>'
              See HELP OFMFILE for more details.

              The OFM file name may be given as an immediate
              argument, overriding OFMFILE.  For example
                         OFMGET  'RAINBOW'
              Note that the apostrophies are required.
