IN4SEQ
Type: Adverb  (Real)
Use:  Data files are stored in AIPS under logical names which
      have 4 parts: a 12-character "name" field, a 6-character
      "class" field, and a numeric "sequence number" field.
      IN4SEQ is used to specify the "sequence number" field for
      the 4th of the input data files used by a verb or task.
      It is used as an integer number between 0 and 9999.
Null value:  0
      Null value means take the image having the highest
      sequence number which is consistent with the other adverb
      name parameters unless explicitly stated otherwise in the
      Help file for the verb or task.
