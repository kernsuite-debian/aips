DOROBUST
Type: Adverb (Real)
Use:  Controls whether a function uses robust methods to determine the
      mean and rms or a simple, single-pass method including all data
      samples.
Default:
      default is 1, > 0 => use robust methods.
Tasks:
  FLAGR.....Edit data based on internal RMS, amplitudes, weights
            DOROBUST controls the averaging across each spectrum
  FINDR.....Find normal values for a uv data set (to guide the use of
            FLAGR).  DOROBUST controls the averaging across each
            spectrum.
