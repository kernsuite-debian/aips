BSFIX
Task:  This task will correct the RA and Dec offsets using the relative
       azimuth and elevation offsets and the recorded time.  These
       offsets are later used to re-grid the corrected beam-switched
       image into ra-Dec coordinates.

Adverbs:
  INNAME.....Input SD file name (name).      Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....Input SD file name (class).     Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......Input SD file name (seq. #).    0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk drive # of input SD file.  0 => any.
  OUTNAME....Output SD file name (name).     Standard defaults.
  OUTCLASS...Output SD file name (class).    Standard defaults.
  OUTSEQ.....Output SD file name (seq. #).   0 => highest unique
  OUTDISK....Disk drive # of output SD file. 0 => highest with
             space for the file.
