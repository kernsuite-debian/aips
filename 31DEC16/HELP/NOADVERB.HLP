ERROR
Type:  Error that can occur because of context saving.

AIPS will restore an old context when starting up, and when doing a GET
or RESTORE 1.  Thus, when new adverbs, verbs, and pseudoverbs are added
to AIPS, they are usually overwritten for all but new users by old
contexts.  You can obtain the latest context by typing in "RESTORE 0".
This will make all adverbs and other symbols available (and
unfortunately set them all to default values).

To avoid this penalty, it is usually possible (beginning with the
15JAN96 release of AIPS) to issue the command COMPRESS.  This command
should be the only command on the line and cannot occur in a RUN file.
COMPRESS will save all of your procedures and adverb values, fetch the
updated (RESTORE 0) basic vocabulary, and then recompile and reload the
saved procedures and adverb values.  COMPRESS also gets rid of wasted
space due to editing or recompiling procedures and to running NEWPARMS
(below).

Beginning with the 15JAN94 release of AIPS, it has been possible to
define new adverbs, verbs, and even pseudoverbs with an AIPS
system-provided RUN file.  Issue the command
         RUN NEWPARMS
as the only command on the input line and all new adverbs, verbs, and
pseudoverbs are defined for you.  The SCALAR adverbs may have new values
given them, but the ARRAY and STRING ones will have your values (if they
were already defined) or 0s and ' 's  if not.
