MAX       LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
MAX:  Function verb to return the maximum value of the arguments
          NO adverbs.  Instead, MAX takes two arguments
                     MAX (value1, value2)
          where value1 and value2 are any numeric scalars and/or
          arrays.

MAX
Type:  Verb      (function: leaves results on the stack)
Use:   To obtain the maximum value of numeric scalars (adverbs,
       subscripted arrays, constants) and/or numeric arrays
       (adverbs).  MAX requires 2 immediate arguments as
                     MAX (value1, value2)
       where value1 and value2 are any numeric scalars or
       arrays.  Examples:
            MAX (3.3, 2.3)           is    3.3
            MAX (-3.3, 2.3)          is    3.3
       and with LEVS = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10; I = -6; APARM = 16
            MAX (LEVS, I)            is   10.0
            MAX (LEVS, 43)           is   43.0
            MAX (LEVS, APARM)        is   16.0

       One can get away with giving MAX only one argument in a small
       number of cases, e.g. print MAX(ANTENNAS) will display the
       maximum value in the array ANTENNAS.  If there are other
       adverbs in the command, MAX will likely pick up one of them to
       include in the max operation.  Thus I = MAX (ANTENNAS) leaves
       the max of I and ANTENNAS on a stack.  In most cases, you are
       better off using two arguments, e.g.
       I = MAX (ANTENNAS, ANTENNAS).
Adverbs:   none.
