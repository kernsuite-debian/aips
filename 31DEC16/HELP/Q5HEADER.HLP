Q5HEADER
Type: Verb
Use:  Q5HEADER lists header information from the catalog file selected
      by the 5th input file name adverbs.  It will list only the first
      image satisfying the selection criteria specified by the
      adverbs.  It lists only the most important parameters and shows
      the coordinate values at the center pixel.  IM5HEAD lists rather
      more parameters and shows the coordinate values at the reference
      pixel.
Adverbs:
  IN5NAME.....5th image name(name).       Standard defaults.
  IN5CLASS....5th image name(class).      Standard defaults.
  IN5SEQ......5th image name(seq.  #).    0 => highest.
  IN5DISK.....5th disk drive # of image.  0 => any.
