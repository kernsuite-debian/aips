UVDEC
Task:  This task will copy only every n'th spectral channel to the
       output uv data set.  This may be useful with data that have had
       spectral smoothing.
Adverbs:
  INNAME.....Input UV file name (name).      Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....Input UV file name (class).     Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......Input UV file name (seq. #).    0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk drive # of input UV file.  0 => any.
  OUTNAME....Output UV file name (name).     Standard defaults.
  OUTCLASS...Output UV file name (class).    Standard defaults.
  OUTSEQ.....Output UV file name (seq. #).   0 => highest unique
  OUTDISK....Disk drive # of output UV file. 0 => highest with
             space for the file.
  BCHAN......Begin channel: 0 -> 1.
  ECHAN......End channel: < BCHAN -> max
  CHINC......Channel increment: 0 -> 1.
