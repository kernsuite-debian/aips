INTPARM
Type: Adverb  (REAL(3))
Use:  Used to specify the parameters of the interpolation function to
      be applied to spectral channels.  SPECR and UVGRD have the most
      general usage as:
      INTPARM(1) = type of interpolation (weighted smoothing) to use
         0 => Weighted substitution (INTPARM(2 and 3) ignored) in
              UVGRD, FFT in SPECR
         1 => Hanning
         2 => Gaussian
         3 => Boxcar
         4 => Sinc (i.e. sin(x)/x)
         5 => Exponential
         6 => Median window
         7 => 2 point
      INTPARM(2) = the "diameter" of the function, i.e. width between
         first nulls of Hanning triangle and sinc function, FWHM of
         Gaussian, Exponential, width of Boxcar and median window.
         Defaults (if < 0.1) are 4, 2, 2, 3, 1.99, 4 channels for
         INTPARM(1) = 1 - 6.
      INTPARM(3) = the diameter over which the convolving function has
         value - in channels.  Defaults: 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1 times
         INTPARM(2) used when input INTPARM(3) < INTPARM(2) (after
         application of defaults).
Null value:  0, see above.
Tasks:
  PCAL.....Determines instrumental polarization for UV data.  INTPARM
           smooths the spectral solutions.
  RLDIF....Determines Right minus Left phase difference, corrects cal
           files.  INTPARM smooths the spectral solutions.
  SPECR....Spectral regridding task for UV data.  INTPARM smooths the
           input to the output (including FFT methods).
  UVGRD....Makes one data set have the spectral structure of another.
           INTPARM smoothe the input visibilities onto the frequencies
           of the output spectrum.
