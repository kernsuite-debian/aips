;   Inserts the character contained in the least significant bits of
;   the INTEGER argument ICHAR into the NCHAR position of the HOLLERITH
;   argument WORD.  It should also work for INTEGER WORD as long as
;   NCHAR is valid.  Characters are numbered from 1 in the order in
;   which they would be printed by a Fortran "A" format specifier.
;   Inputs:
;      ICHAR   I     Character to insert in LS bits
;      NCHAR   I     Position in "word" to store character
;   Output:
;      WORD    R/I   Word into which character is to be inserted
;----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                ; Define argument list offsets.
ICHAR = 4
WORD = 8
NCHAR = 12
