Single dish calibration table         CLdssvv
 
 

A. Overview
 
   This extension table for a uv data set contains gain and baseline
offset corrections to be applied to single dish data in a uv data like
format.
 
Names: The file name is CSdsssvv where d = release code, sss=catalog
number and vv = version number.
 
B.  File structure.

     Logical records consist of the information for all IFs
for a single beam.  An IF (channel) is considered to be the output from
a single recorded channel which needs to be calibrated independently,
multiple frequency channels derived from a single recorded channel,
(e.g. spectral line data) are not considered separate IFs.

     A pair of IFs consists of orthogonally polarized signals at the
same frequency.  All IF pairs must be identical, i.e. have the same number
and types of IF.
 
 
    The file header record contains the following KEYWORDs:
 
     Keyword  Code   Description
     -------- ----  ---------------------------------------------------
     NO_BEAM  I     The number of beams for which there is
                    information
     NO_POL   I     The number of IFs per IF pair.
     NO_IF    I     The number of IF pairs.
   Table entries:

                                  calibrated = factor * (raw + offset)
                                  for 1st IF of pair. (see note 1)
    OFFSET 1                 *E   offset
    RAOFF 1         Degrees  *E   RA correction
    DECOFF 1        Degrees  *E   Declination correction

The following are present only if NO_POL = 2

                                  for 2nd IF of pair. (see note 1)
    OFFSET 2                 *E   offset
    RAOFF 2         Degrees  *E   RA correction
    DECOFF 2        Degrees  *E   Declination correction

C. User notes.

  The "code" column is element_count + basic type code.
basic type codes: D=Double precision, E=single precision,
   A=character, J=long integer, L=logical, I=short integer, X=bit.


      Note 1.  FACTOR n, OFFSET n, RAOFF n and DECOFF n
are arrays whose dimensions are given by the header keyword NO_IF.

 
D.  Routines to write CS files:
     Routine CSINI will create/initilize/open/read-keywords-from/
write-keywords-to a solution table and TABCS will do I/O.
