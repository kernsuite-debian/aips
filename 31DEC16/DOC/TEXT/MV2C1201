Chapter 12. Available Routines in AIPS


     This chapter consists primarily of listings of special documenta-
tion files.  These files contain lists of the Programs, Subroutines,
and Functions within the AIPS system by name and brief description.
These lists act as a directory to the AIPS software and a "shopping"
list for programmers who need utility subroutines.  The names of these
special documentation files are printed at the top of each page.

     The primary file, called WHATSUP, lists all programs and all
subroutines and functions which are in the linkage editor element
libraries.  Single purpose subroutines are normally stored in source
libraries as part of the source code for the task which uses them.  As
a result, they do not appear in linkage editor libraries.  Such subrou-
tines are listed only in the documentation file called TASKSUP.  The
routines used solely in the programs AIPS, AIPSC, AIPSB, BATER, and
POPSGN are kept in separate source and linkage editor libraries.  They
are listed in the documentation file called POPSUP.  Routines which
drive the array processor and the CPU-based array processor simulation
versions are listed in the documentation file APSUP.

     Include files are, by now, numerous and are listed in INCSUP in the
hope of keeping them organized.

     The other files, called UTILSUP, TVSUP, IOSUP, and APPLSUP, present
the lists of WHATSUP organized by catagories.  Some routines from
POPSUP are also included.  Useful routines are often listed in more
than one catagory, so that they may be more easily found by the
"shopper".  These files must be maintained by the programming staff.
