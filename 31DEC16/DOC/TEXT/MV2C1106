F. UNIX/AIPS INSTALLATION WORK SHEET.

   This work sheet can be filled in to provide the data necessary
to run the installation procedure.  Chapter B and chapter C of the
instructions contain explanations useful in filling out this form.

   The number of sample answers and blanks provided for filling
in your answers are for a larger than average system.  You may be
asked for a fewer or larger number of responses depending on your
values for the system parameters.

   The commands to get the initial installation procedure from
tape and to start it up are:

1. Login to the area that is or will be the home for you AIPS
   system. The home directory should not be too far from "root"
   since routines have been coded with variables of finite length
   (72 characters) to hold the full pathname to AIPS files.

2. Create a directory via the UNIX command "mkdir" with a name
   corresponding to what you want "NEW" to be called.  We recommend
   the same as the release date of the version of AIPS being installed
   for the sake of simplicity, e.g., 15JUL84, 15OCT84, 15JAN85, etc.
   Change to the newly created directory.

3. From the "NEW" directory, tar the entire contents of the AIPS
   system tape onto disk. Since the syntax of tar varies from UNIX
   to UNIX, there is no way to automate this step. The amount of
   disk space required for this step is roughly 45 Mb, however,
   there are no doubt files that are of little or no interest to
   you. For example, if you don't have a Floating Point Systems
   120B array processor, the FPS subdirectory can be deleted,
   however, even if you don't have one of the supported TV display
   devices, you still need at least one of these subroutine libraries
   for something with which to link AIPS. We recommend the tried and
   true IIS subdirectory. Someday we will have a dummy library for
   this purpose. If you are feeling bold, you can selectively tar
   the contents of the tape to disk by specifying particular
   directories, e.g.,

      tar x...      ./AIPS ./APL ./DOC ./FPS ./HELP ./HIST ./INC \
      ./NOTST ./PSAP ./UNIX ./VMS

4. Step 3 will down load a file in the subdirectory UNIX called ILOAD.
   ILOAD is a shell script that compiles and links a C program that
   can be found in the same directory called ILOAD.c producing an
   executable module called ILOAD then executes it.  The first part of
   ILOAD will prompt you for various system parameters.  The remainder
   of ILOAD prompts you for information based on the system you define
   (e.g., full pathnames of devices, directories and link libraries).

      The worksheet below is provided to help you prepare suitable
   answers to these prompts.

9. "OLD" version of AIPS.

   Here ILOAD wants to know the name of the topmost directory for any
previous installation of AIPS on your system.  If this is your first
installation or if you don't have any plans (not even temporarily) to
maintain both an "OLD" and a "NEW" AIPS installation on your system,
enter "-1".  ILOAD will define the shell variable OLD to be the same
as NEW if you enter "-1".  If you enter, say 15SEP83, ILOAD will check
for the existence of $HOME/15SEP83.  Therefore, you MUST answer this
prompt truthfully.

ENTER NAME OF THE TOP MOST DIRECTORY OF YOUR OLD VERSION OF AIPS
USUALLY A DATE LIKE 15SEP83 (-1 ==> OLD=NEW)

Example answers         Your answer

15SEP83, -1             _________________________

10. Device, directory, special peripheral link library, etc., pathnames.

   In most cases, ILOAD will accept the string "" as the answer to
these prompts.  Where this is not acceptable, special answers like
"0" or "-1" and their implications will appear in parentheses at the
end of the prompt line.  The answer "" is allowed so that if the real
answer is unknown, ILOAD will generate shell variables with null values.
When running AIPS, null valued shell variables will result in meaningful
error messages whereas the consequences of incorrect values are
not predictable at this time.  The prompts that accept special answers
are for shell variables fundamental to the installation process and
therefore require special handling.

The answer to ILOAD regarding system parameter 1 (# disks) must be at
least 1.  These are the disks where AIPS system and user data files will
be stored.  ILOAD will ask you for the full pathname of the file system
corresponding to each of the n disks you specified.  These file systems
must exist prior to running ILOAD since pathnames that cannot be found
will be rejected.  These can be simple directories of the AIPS account
but this is not advised (if avoidable) since you will undoubtably find
yourself squeezed out of system maintenance/development space by user
data.
