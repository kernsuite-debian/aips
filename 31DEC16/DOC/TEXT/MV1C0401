Chapter IV. All the details


    This chapter contains an alphabetized listing of all of the HELP
files available to the user of AIPS at run time.  Each of the standard
adverbs, verbs, and tasks appears in this chapter with a description of
their functions and a list of cross references.  In addition, there are
special HELP files to explain generalized concepts such as tasks and
verbs.  There is a special file included in HELP which is used to
create the initial AIPS environment by POPSGN.  It is called POPSDAT
and may be of some interest.

     Following the HELP file listings, the INPUTS files are listed.
The center 2 columns in those files give the lower and upper bounds
of the allowed values for the numeric adverbs.
