Updating instructions for 15-Jan-1984 release (Save/Get ver 5).
 
 
IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.
 
Principles:  This update involves no file structure changes over the
15-NOV-1983 release.  All files may be preserved if you choose.
 
   If your current system is a 15-May-1983 or a more recent release, it
will be possible to have an OLD and a NEW area.  In this case your
current NEW area will become your OLD area.  Just enter the name you
are using for your current release (15MAY83 for example) when the update
procedure prompts for the OLD area.
 
   If your current system is older than 15-May-1983, the many file
structure changes in the 15-May-1983 release will prevent you from
running an OLD and a NEW since both systems access the same data area.
If you have an older system, you must update your current data files
by following the file structure update instructions for all releases
that follow your current release.
 
   NOTE that the save get version number has increased to 5 for this
release.  Please review chapter A-2 for running program DELSG.
