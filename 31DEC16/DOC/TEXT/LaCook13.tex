     The complete lists of software in \AIPS\ are kept up-to-date in
certain special files which may then be accessed with the {\tt AIPS}
verb \hbox{{\tt ABOUT}}.  Semi-automatic software makes these listing
files using the primary and secondary keywords entered by \AIPS\
programmers in the numerous help files.  The explanations given for
each symbol are also those entered by the programmers as the
``one-liner'' descriptions of the symbol for which the help file is
written.  The lists of primary and secondary keywords may be viewed
directly by typing:
\dispt{HELP \qs CATEGORY \CR}{to view primary keywords}
\dispt{HELP \qs SECONDARY \CR}{to view secondary keywords}
\dispe{The help file for {\tt ABOUT} is more explanatory, however.
The general help file (for {\tt HELP} itself) lists a number of
general help files which will be of interest.  These are also
mentioned in the section called {\tt INFORMATION} below.}

     The following sections are verbatim reproductions of the various
listing files used by {\tt ABOUT} and are roughly current to the {\tt
15JAN95} release of \hbox{\AIPS}.  Each section title is the name of
the keyword which is used as the {\tt ABOUT} topic.  Each line within
a section lists a task, verb, pseudoverb, procedure, adverb, or {\tt
RUN} file with a very brief description of its function.  Pseudoverbs
come in two flavors: those that act roughly like verbs and those that
must be treated specially, \ie\ that must appear alone on a line or
only in certain contexts.  The help file for each pseudoverb should
clarify the its grammatical limits.  Typing
\dispt{HELP\qs {\it name} \CR}{ }
\dispe{where {\it name} is one of the entries in the left-hand column,
will give more useful information about that \AIPS\ symbol. }

\bbve\begin{verbatim}
ADVERB
Type:  General type of POPS symbol
Use:   Adverbs are the symbols used to address values.  They
       may be REAL (single-precision floating point), ARRAY
       (multiply-dimensioned REALs), or STRING (character
       strings with or without subscripts).  The user may
       create new adverbs by defining them while typing or
       editing procedures.
Grammar:   Adverb names may be used either in compile mode
       or in regular execute mode.  In the former, their
       pointers are compiled with the procedure and their
       values, at the time the procedure is invoked, are
       used during the execution of the procedure.
Usage examples:
       ARRAY2 = ARRAY1
       ARRAY3(I,J) = 23.6
       CHAN = 4
       STRARRY = 'STR1','STR2','STR3',STRAR2
       DUM3 (24, I, STRARRY)
    =====>  Character string data must be enclosed in quotes!
    =====>  This allows the compiler to tell data from adverb
            names and allows embedded special characters.

\vskip 0.5pt\todx{ABOUT BATCH}\iodx{batch}
\bbve\begin{verbatim}
Type:  Operations to prepare, submit, and monitor batch jobs
Use:   There are two batch streams of AIPS, each capable of
   processing a queue of jobs.  To run a batch job, one must
   first prepare the text of the job in a work file.  This text
   may contain any normal AIPS/POPS statement including RUN,
   except for verbs and tasks related to batch preparation, the
   TV, the TEK4012 green screen, and the tape drives.  When the
   text is ready, it may be submitted to the batch AIPS.  On
   the way, it is tested for errors and is submitted only if
   none are found.  After successful submission, the work file
   and any RUN files involved may be altered without affecting
   the job.  Array processor tasks are allowed only in queue
   #2 and only at night.  They may be submitted at any time,
   however.  Line printer output should be directed to a user
   chosen file (via adverb OUTPRINT).  If OUTPRINT = ' ', all
   tasks and AIPS itself will write to a file named
   PRTFIL:BATCHjjj.nnn, where jjj is the job number in hex and
   nnn is the user number in hex.  Note that all print jobs
   are concatenated into the specified file(s).
Adverbs:
   BATQUE     Number of queue to be used ( 1 or 2 or more )
   JOBNUM     Job number involved (101 - 164, 201 -264, ...)

Type:  General type of POPS symbol
Use:   Pseudoverbs are magic symbols which cause FORTRAN routines to
       carry out specific actions.  Unlike verbs, pseudoverbs are
       executed as soon as they are encountered by the compiler even
       in compile mode.  In general, the FORTRAN routines which are
       invoked will parse the remainder of the input line under
       special, non-standard rules.  Any normal code typed on the line
       ahead of the pseudoverb will not be executed.

TASKS
Type:  General type of POPS symbol (not in symbol table)
Use:   Tasks are separate programs which may be started by
       AIPS and which receive their input parameters from
       AIPS.  In the interactive AIPS, tasks run
       asynchronously from AIPS.  In the batch AIPS,
       the language processor waits for each task to finish
       before starting another one.
Grammar:    TASK = 'name' ;   GO
       will cause the task whose name is assigned to the
       string adverb TASK to be started.  Note: the name
       should have no leading blanks and should be no longer
       than 5 characters.
Alternative grammar:    GO  name ;
       where name is the name of the task to be run.
Related adverbs:
   TASK       Task name
   DOWAIT     On "GO", wait for task completion before returning
                 to AIPS control
   VERSION    Version of task to be executed.
   QCREATE    Create files by fast or more reliable methods
Related verbs:
   GO         Initiate a shed task
   HELP       List information about a task
   INP        List adverb values for a task
   INPUTS     Same as INP but also written to MSG file
   SPY        Inquire which tasks are active
   WAITTASK   Suspend AIPS operation until a specific task
                 is complete

       by the programmers and their meaning remains fixed
       at least until the programmers change their minds.
Grammar:   Verbs may be given either in compile mode or in
       regular execute mode.  In the former, their pointers
       are stored with the procedure and they are executed
       when the procedure is invoked.  In the latter, they
       are compiled with the other statements and parameters
       on the input line and then executed before a new
       input line is read.
Execution:  Verbs are executed when the line in which they
       appear is executed and are simply referenced by their
       name.  The syntax "GO verb_name" is converted by AIPS to
       "TPUT verb_name ; verb_name" which saves the adverbs of
       "verb_name" for a later TGET and then executes
       "verb_name".  The syntax "TASK = 'verb_name' ; GO" will
       not work.
