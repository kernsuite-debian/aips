Fringe search files   DRdssvv
 
 
A. Overview
 
Function: This extension file for a uv data set contains information
about the solutions derived from a fringe search.
 
Details: DR files use the EXTINI-EXTIO file structure with various
global parameters kept in the header record.
 
Names: The file name is DRdsssvv where d is disk number, sss=catalog
number and vv = version number. 
 
B.  File structure.
 
 
    The file header record contains the following:
 
    Location
  I*2  R*4  R*8   Size            Description
   57              I*2    NANT, the number of antennas.
   58              I*2    NIF, the number of IFs (1 or 2) if there
                          are 2 they are assumed to be RR and LL.
   59              I*2    NVAL, the number of values per antenna-IF
                          (see below for details)
 
 
   Logical record structure.
 
   Location
  I*2  R*4  R*8   Size  Name          Description
    1    1         R*4  Time, center of true solution interval (days)
    3    2         R*4  Actual solution interval (days)
    5    3         R*4  Sum of weights for first IF
    7    4         R*4  Sum of weights of second (if any) IF.
    9    5         R*4  (VALUE(IV,IA,IF),IV=1,NVAL, IA=1,NANT, IF=1,NIF)
                        VALUE(1,*,*)=Antenna phase offset (rad.)
                        VALUE(2,*,*)=Antenna phase rate offset (rad/day)
                        VALUE(3,*,*)=Antenna delay offset (rad/Hz)
 
 
C. User notes.
 
     When calling EXTINI make sure the calling routine has the common
/DCHCOM/ (includes DDCH.INC and CDCH.INC) and use BP = 2 and
   LREC = (4 + NVAL*NANT*NIF) * NWDPFP
 
     Phase rates can be converted to mHz by multiplying by 1.8420711E-3
and delays can be converted to nanoseconds by multiplying by
1.5915494 E8.

     EXTINI and EXTIO,  DR files are currently written by VBFIT.
 
 
E.  Routines to access DR files: EXTINI and EXTIO.
