Updating instructions for 15-Mar-1983 release


IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.

Principles:  This update involves no file structure changes over the
15-Jan-1983 release.  All files may be preserved if you choose.  The
SAVE / GET files will lack some new verbs and adverbs, however.  No
serious problems should arise from keeping them.

   If your current system is a 15-Jan-1983 release, it will be 
possible to have an OLD and a NEW area.  In this case your current
NEW area will become your OLD area.  Just enter 15JAN83 when
the update procedure prompts for the OLD area.

   If your current system is older than 15-Jan-1983, the many file
structure changes in the 15-Jan-1983 release will prevent you from
running an OLD and a NEW since both systems access the same data area.
If you have an older system, you must update your current data files
by following the file structure update instructions for all releases
that follow your current release.

  This is the first AIPS to knowingly use features of VMS 3.0. If you
are on a previous release, you should dummy two subroutines,
[AIPS.15MAR83.AIPS.ZSUB.VMS]ZFREE.FOR and
[AIPS.15MAR83.APL.ZSUB.VMS]ZMOUNT.FOR, after running ILOAD and before
running IBUILD.  One way to dummy the routines is to edit them and
delete all the lines of code except the first line (the SUBROUTINE
statement) and the RETURN and END statements.
