Updating instructions for 15-Jul-1983 release (Save/Get ver 4).


IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.

Principles:  This update involves no file structure changes over the
15-May-1983 release except for the message files, which are taken
care of automatically.  All files may be preserved if you choose.  The
SAVE / GET files will lack some new verbs and adverbs, however.  No
serious problems should arise from keeping them.

   If your current system is a 15-May-1983 release, it will be 
possible to have an OLD and a NEW area.  In this case your current
NEW area will become your OLD area.  Just enter 15MAY83 when
the update procedure prompts for the OLD area.

   If your current system is older than 15-May-1983, the many file
structure changes in the 15-May-1983 release will prevent you from
running an OLD and a NEW since both systems access the same data area.
If you have an older system, you must update your current data files
by following the file structure update instructions for all releases
that follow your current release.

   Starting with this release, message files belong to a particular user
number instead of an AIPS number.  The file names of the new message
files will have the user number in hexadecimal as part of the file name.
The user number also forms the extension to the file name to facillitate
backing up all of one users data.  For example the message file for
user 100 is MS106400.064.  The old message files have no extensions.
If you are not running an OLD AIPS (or after 15JUL83 becomes the OLD AIPS)
you may delete the old message files.
