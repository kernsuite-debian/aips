Updating instructions for 15-July-1984 release (Save/Get ver 6).
 
 
IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.
 
Principles:  This update involves no file structure changes over the
15-MAY-1984 release.  All files may be preserved if you choose.  A
change in the way Tasks are spawned will cause some incompatibilities
between your OLD and NEW AIPS.

   Tasks are now initiated with the LIB$SPAWN command instead of
the SYS$CREPRC command.  This change will cause the context of
the parent process (AIPS in our case) to be copied to the spawned
subprocess (an AIPS task).  This means, among other things, that
process logical names from the parent process are available in the
task.  This will give the AIPS manager more flexibility (perhaps
dangerous ones) in setting up AIPS for different users.  A problem
occurs when a NEW AIPS spawns an OLD task.  The OLD task will not
shut down correctly, and will issue a "$" prompt after if finishes.
The user must then logout with an "LO" so that AIPS can continue.  An
AIPS manager who chooses to run an OLD AIPS must make sure that users
are aware of this possibility.  There should be no problem in running
OLD tasks from OLD AIPS or NEW tasks from NEW or OLD AIPS.
 
   If your current system is older than 15-May-1983, the many file
structure changes in the 15-May-1983 release will prevent you from
running an OLD and a NEW since both systems access the same data area.
If you have an older system, you must update your current data files
by following the file structure update instructions for all releases
that follow your current release.
