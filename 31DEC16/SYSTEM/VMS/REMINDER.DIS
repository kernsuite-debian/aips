! This file lists the people who will get reminders of what is new in BANANA
! mail for the previous week.  It is NOT the list of BANANA mail receivers.
! At the VLA, BANANA mail only goes to the DBANANAS account and people can
! access the banana mail file/folder whenever they want.

! The following are not real accounts (at least not at the VLA!)  They
! are shown only for illustration purposes

SHIRE::BILBO		! DECnet example; BILBO has account on remote node
FRODO			! but FRODO is on the local machine.
ST%"Gandalf"		! You can use this if software tools mail is available

EXOS%"FooBear@Shire.MidEarth.Fict"	! Excelan software example
