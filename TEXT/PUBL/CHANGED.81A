    1.  April 23, 1981    All modules                Eric
        Copied from CV Vax [RPOPS] area to [TEST]
        moved  to CV Modcomp June 1,  to VLA June 26,1981

************

   1.  Feb 16, 1981                   Gary
       All modules initially copied from the VLA VAX on the above
       date.

   2.  Feb 25, 1981     many (see below)             David
       The error handling of the file-related Z-routines has
       been improved. Care has been taken to ensure that in all
       cases the error code is returned to the FCB whenever an
       FCB is one of the call arguments. A system routine is
       called through ZQMSG to translate those annoying errors
       that fall in the "OTHER" category. The routines should now
       return error codes AS ADVERTISED. Minor logic errors have
       been found and corrected. The prologue comments have been
       cleaned up.
       Moved to VLA Vax effective 3/1/81
       ZCREAT : updates space used, now FORTRAN calling ZQCREA.
                It now checks for legal volume number.
                also returns IERR=3, not enough space.
       ZDESTR :
       ZEXPND : also updates space used in file header.
       ZOPEN  : Eric's changes + calls ZQMSG for "OTHER".
       ZQASSN :
       ZQCLOS : does not call ZQMSG to avoid reentrancy.
       ZQCREA : old ZCREAT + updates space used in file header.
       ZQDEVN : added to find device given the channel.
       ZQEXP  :
       ZQIO   : doesn't call ZQMSG to avoid reentrancy.
       ZQMSG  : added to translate "OTHER" type errors.
       ZQOPEN : doesn't call ZQMSG to avoid reentrancy.
       ZQRENA : volume unavailable was not being returned.
       ZQTRUN : also updates space used in file header.
       ZQTAPE : did not always return error code to FCB.
       ZQWIO  : did not always return err to FCB. Calls ZQMSG.
       ZRENAM : (new routine  requested by Walter )
       ZTKQIO :

       If IVOL = 0 for OPCODEs SRCH,OPEN,LIST,QLST, the
       program will loop over all known volumes.
       Also:  error code of 9 means warning on
       CSTA (e.g. CLRD if STATUS was REST or WRIT).
       This used to be error code of 8, which was ambiguous.
       CHANGED IN RPOPS.IPOPS and put in SUBLIB

             Fix up typing
             Adapt to change in freq units, NCOR location
             Stop wiping out the Physical type in header
       Fred in CV:
         a) Checked the weight computations.  Found no
       problems.
         b) Fixed bug in SOLVE2 connected with AVAC option.
       Now copy R gains to L.
         c) In VISCOR, now do not set weights for flagged data
       to zero.  Instead negate the absolute value of the
       weight attached to the input visibility.
         d) Consolidated the work arrays required by SOLVE,
       SOLVE2, and GCALC.  Now they are all declared in SOLVE.
       Some are now placed in a labelled common, /WRK/, so that
       the storage may be shared with GETMOD.
         e) Added NITER option to select the number of CLEAN
       components to be used.
       Added descriptions of NITER option in the HELPS file
       and in the INPUTS file in TEST.
         f) In VISCOR, repaired the overflow test.  Before,
       only positive overflows were detected.
         g) Repaired the scratch file destruction.  Gain file
       now gets destroyed in VISCOR unless the PLOT option is
       active.
         h) Visibility input file sometimes was being left in
       READ status.  Repaired this by changing occurrences of
       FIND1 to FIND in VISCOR.
         Moved to Modcomp, VLA July 27.

             Walter

        These are three test programs that I leave for your
        digestion.  REGLR is a program written by Fred that I
        have improved.  It tries to improve dirty maps (i.e.
        reduce sidelobes) with an iterative "regularizing" procedure.
        That is, it tries iteratively to minimize a specified norm
        of a model map, which is the weighted sum of the mean square
        deviation of the model UV plane and the measured UV plane,
        and a second norm which can be of several types, e.g.
        a sobolov smoothness norm, or a maximum likelihood norm.
        The resulting map has a somewhat undefined beam pattern,
        and is normalized to flux/pixel (READ: KELVINS) rather
        than flux/beam.  My version has 2 de luxe features:
           if the input map is a CLEAN map, the clean components
        are added into map as delta functions before the end.
        This allows you to "regularize" a residual map after
        cleaning it a bit (use BMAJ=-1).
           you can convolve the output map with a circular
        gaussian function.  If well chosen this at least leaves
        you with a more or less well defined beam.

        CONVL convolves a given map with a circular gaussian.
        The normalization is such that the brightness of a
        highly extended source remains constant after convolution,
        rather than the peak of a point source.  Could easily be
        modified to change the normalization and to use elliptical
        gaussians.

        JAFPL is a TV camera test program.  When you run it,
        it disables the LUTs for the refresh channels, and
        enables the LUT for the video digitizer.  It then does
        one of 5 things.  (1) use the feedback loop to clear
        refresh channel 2.  (2) use the feedback loop to put
        the TV image into channel 2. (3) Read the contents
        of a specific LUT. (4) Initialize IFM to standard for
        feedback.  (5) quit.  On leaving it disables the TV camera.
        Moved: to VLA Sept 18, 1981.

  293.  August 13, 1981         Lots                       Eric
        A major rewrite of the position evaluation routines has been
        made necessary by the coming of 3-dimensional, transposed
        image.  In particular, some routines assumed that the axes
        could be in arc sec and even that they were LL,MM in that
        order.  The following is a list of the changes designed to
        handle the new data and correct the poor assumptions.

        FNDX       New: finds x val given xpix,yval replaces purpose
                   of FNDRA although the similarity stops there
        FNDY       New: finds y val given ypix, xval , ditto
        LABINI     New: calls SETLOC, converts to center-rel axis

  294.  August 14, 1981     YTVCIN,  YCURSE                   Eric
        For some reason, the CV Vax IIS seems to work differently
        from the others.  It will do a smooth scroll (SCXINC=1) and
        has a different and more reasonable set of zoom correction
        needs.  The new YCURSE may port to our other machines, but
        the YTVCIN must be handled more carefully.
        Moved YCURSE to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  295.  Aug 14, 1981   CNVRT  plus HELP and INPUTS           Gary
        New task to convert to I*2 or R*4 type maps, depending
        on the input map type.

        New subroutine, used with 295, to copy an I*2 file into
        a corresponding R*4 file.  This program is the inverse
        of MSCALF.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  297.  Aug 14, 1981         SETPAR                         Gary
        Added missing goto after graphics devices question.

  298.  Aug. 18, 1981        ASCAL                         Fred
        I moved the version of ASCAL that is described in item
        282 to the CV VAX, installed it in the TEST area, and
        verified that it works on the CV VAX.

 299.   Aug 18, 1981        UVLOD                          Bill
        Fixed bug in file compression.  Now makes file 128 vis
        larger than is actually there.
        Moved MODCOMP this date. to VLA Sept. 18.

  300.  Aug 19, 1981        most all UV data base routines Bill
        Installed floating uv data system.  Copied the following:

  301.  Aug. 19, 1981      ASCAL                        Fred
             I modified ASCAL to use the floating-point visibi-
        lity format and tested it on the CV Vax.  I installed
        this version in the TEST area on the CV Vax, but no-
        where else.  A few changes will be needed to make it
        work on the Modcomp (I'll probably shorten the visibi-
        lity buffers).
             I also repaired the subroutine GAINPL so that it
        destroys the gain file after generating a plot.  This
        I did only in the floating-point version.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

        Made MDESTR smart enough to leave cat entry on errors,
        Then AU3 and MAPCLR can call it.  DIE resets R/W type 2 to
        1 on normal completion, MAPCLR destroys any type 2's.

  304.  Aug 21, 1981       MINIT                       Eric
        Added code to prevent it from reading too much on the
        initial 1 or 2 reads (messy, but like MDISK)
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  305.  Aug. 24, 1981      ASCAL                      Fred
        In the floating-point version (which is present only
        in the TEST area on the CV Vax) I corrected the call to
        SUMARY.  The CLEAN component fluxes were not being read
        properly.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

                       also DSUB.INC,CSUB.INC,DUVH.INC,CUVH.INC
       Added new task which subtracts CLEAN components from
       a UV data base.  Corrected errors in the source version
       of RECT from the [FPS] library.  PTSUB is a VFC routine
       which is called by UVSUB and in turn calls RECT.

        VLA version of AU7.FOR brought from VLA.  The RESCALE
        verb was modified for more natural change of the Scale
        factor and offset.   AU7.FOR has been placed in [TEST.AIPS]
        but AIPS has not been recompiled yet
        Moved to MODCOMP on Sept 1.

  310.  Aug 25, 1981    [TEST.HELP]UVSUB,TASKS,MAPCLEAN Bill
        Added/or changed these inputs files to reflect the existence
        of task UVSUB.  Also:
        [TEST.INPUTS]UVSUB.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  311.  Aug 25, 1981      UVPGET, UVMAP                 Bill
        Changed so that there is no longer a test to see if
        FREQ .le. 1 GHz as a trap fo old data.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  312.  Aug. 25, 1981     ASCAL                         Fred
        (To the floating-point version in TEST on the CV Vax)
        I added a new subroutine, GCALC1, whose purpose is
        experimental and to compute phase corruptions by
        solving an L1 minimization problem rather than by
        solving a least-squares (L2) problem.  GCALC1, in
        its present form, seems to behave reliably, but it is
        inefficient.  It doesn't yet calculate solutions for
        full complex gains.  ASCAL.FOR and ASCAL.EXE are in
        the TEST area, but GCALC1.FOR, etc., resides only in
        the FRED area.  The new subroutine is invoked by
        setting BPARM(6) equal to one.

  313.  Aug. 25, 1981     ASCAL                      Fred
        I appended the code for GCALC1 (GCALC1.FOR) to
        the rest of ASCAL, ASCAL.FOR, so that the program
        may be moved, in toto.  Creature only inhabits CV
        Vax at present.  GCALC1 is described in item 312.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  314.  Aug. 26, 1981     XFOUR.MAR                 David & Bill
        Added David's new assembler FFT routine to the PSAP
        area.  DSKFFT with the new routine takes about 55%
        of the time that it took with the FORTRAN FFT.
        Moved to VLA Sept. 18.

  315.  Aug. 26-27, 1981  ASCAL                     Fred
             To the floating-point version of ASCAL in the TEST
        area on the CV Vax I added a new subroutine, named FLAG,
        which is still under development and whose purpose is to
        flag deviant data points after the telescope gains have
        been computed.  FLAG is invoked by setting BPARM(7) pos-
        itive.  Visibilities which, after correction, differ
        from the model visibility by more than XSTD standard de-
        viations are flagged.  XSTD is given by BPARM(8).  No
        weighting is used in computing the rms visibility resi-
        dual, and only the visibilities which received full
        weight in computing the gain solutions are considered as
        candidates for flagging (and only these points are used
        in computing the rms).  This approach, in a typical
        application in which the input model does not model the
        extended emission, prevents the program from flagging
        short-spacings.
             Solutions for the antenna gains from the new L1
        minimization subroutine, GCALC1, are far less sensitive
        to wild points than those from the least-squares routine
        GCALC.  So it isn't essential to recompute the antenna
        gains after data have been discarded.  GCALC1, as well
        as FLAG, requires more development.
             I had to lengthen the gain records by 2048 bytes
        in order for them to hold the 2x378 baseline flags.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  316. Aug. 27, 1981    UVINIT                     Bill
       Fixed bug which caused improper operation when disk I/O
       was in integral numbers of blocks but there was a visibility
       offset which did not correspond to an integral number of blocks.
       The only program that I know of that was affected was PRTUV
       which has been relinked.
       Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  317. Aug. 27, 1981    UVSUB                      Bill
       Two changes:
       1)  Fixed bug which caused failure when more than 1024
           components were subtracted.
       2)  Added ADVERB BITER which allows the specification of the
           first CLEAN component in the file to be subracted.
       Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  318. Aug. 28, 1981    VBOUT                     Bill
       This routine was not updated when the rest of the floating
       uv data software waas installed.  It has not been copied to
       [TEST.NOTST].  This routine is called only by UVIBM.
       Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  319.  Aug. 28, 1981  APCLN,[TEST.INPUTS and HELP]APCLN. Bill
       Added BADDISK to the inputs.
       Also did some cleaning up: DIECLN was removed and replaced
       with the standard call to DIE in the main routine.
       Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  320.  Aug. 28, 1981  PASS1,PASS2                        Bill
        Standardized a bit: call to DIECLN removed and a return
        code installed.  Also removed all calls to ZUNSGN and
        ZUNADD and made some (but not all) values sent to AP
        routines P I*4.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  321.  Aug. 28, 1981     APXPOS                          Bill
        Standarized: call to DIECLN removed and a return error code
        installed.  Removed call to ZUNSGN and make all values sent
        to AP routines P I*4.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  322.  Aug. 28, 1981     MCUBE    (plus helps, inputs)   Gary
        New task to make a 3D R*4 image from set of 2D images.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  323.  Aug. 28, 1981                                     Gary
        New subroutines to go with 322.
        CHKMAP checks to see if 2D map can fit in 3D map.
        LUPAX  lines up axis in 2 image headers, swapping if necessary.
        WRPLAN writes a I*2 2D subimage into a plane of an R*4 3D image
        WRBLNK writes R*4 blank pixels into a plane.
        SWAPAX swaps axis values in a header.
        COMPAX compares axis of two image headers, counts differences.
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  324.  Aug. 30, 1981            ASCAL                  Fred
        Several changes (to the version in TEST on CV Vax):
          1.  In VISCOR I added a 4x4 array of counters.  For RR, LL,
        RL, and LR the program now counts the number of visibility
        points which were previously flagged, the number flagged due
        to undetermined gain solutions, the number edited out by the
        subroutine FLAG, and the number of points remaining.  This
        information is printed in the message file and is written in
        the history file.
          2.  Information on auto-editing now is written to the
        history file, as well as a message whenever the L1 gain
        solution routine was used.
          3.  Descriptions of the auto-editing options, BPARM(7) and
        BPARM(8), were added to the HELPS and INPUTS files.  A
        description of BPARM(6), which selects the L1 gain solution
        routine, was also added in these files.
          4.  I corrected errors in the HELPS and INPUTS files which
        were introduced earlier (See item #307).
        Moved to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  325.  Aug. 30, 1981           APCLN                  Bill
        Fixed bug introduced in last change which causes the dirty
        and beam maps not to be unflagged when the program finished.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  326.  Aug. 30, 1981           UVSUB                  Bill
        Program now correctly (I hope) takes into account the
        difference between the CLEAN map center and the UV reference
        position.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18

  327.  Sept. 1, 1981          UVSUB                  Bill
        fixed bug left over from above.  The reference center was
        shifted the wrong way.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  328.  Sept. 1, 1981          UVMAP                  Bill
        Fixed MAPOUT/MAPHIS so that non-map file luns are used
        in the history I/O. This should fix the problem of extending
        history files.
        Moved: to Modcomp Sept 4, to VLA Sept. 18.

  329.  Sept. 1, 1981          IMEAN                  Ed
        Fixed minor errors in some format statements.
        Moved: MODCOMP and VLA

  330.  September 1, 1981         Lots                         Eric
        The advent of transposed imagery has brought home a design
        flaw in our IO system: the waste of disk space on short rows.
        A new standard is now imposed: if more than 1 row will fit
        completely in a sector, then do so.  When packed this way,
        rows may not span sector boundaries.  Also each plane must
        begin on a sector boundary.  Almost all tasks must be relinked
        because of this.  The other changes are:
        MINIT  : Handle such structure - uses 3 free words / FTAB entry
        MDISK  : Handle the short row case
        MSCALE : Allow subimaging, loop over planes (NY not NYTOT now)
        MSCALF :   "       "         "   "     "           "
        MAPOPN : Fix bug which cleared someone else's write flag
        DIE    : Closes all open files now.
        MAPSIZ : Compute new map file sizes correctly w new standards
        MAPSNC : Use corrected MAPSIZ, open scratch file also
        MCREAT : Use corrected MAPSIZ
        COMOFF : Compute plane offset correctly with new standards

        FITTP  : Use BLC, TRC; Do a plane at a time
        IBMTP  : Use BLC, TRC; Write out more than 1 plane if desired
        TRANS  : Change to new disk structure
        IMLOD  : Write out 1 plane at a time; use DIE, /CFILES/

  335.  Sept. 3, 1981        ASCAL                     Fred
           I made three major changes to the floating-point ver-
        sion in the TEST area on the CV Vax:
           1.)  In the subroutine SOLVE there was a bug in the
        loop that gets executed when the data are to be averaged
        over finite time intervals.  The final averages were be-
        ing computed erroneously; the result was that the gain
        solution routine would either fail to converge, and then
        flag the data for the final time interval, or that it
        would converge on a crazy solution appropriate for the
        garbage data.  The latter would result in severe contami-
        nation of the data at the end of the output file.  This
        problem was evident in the gain plots.  The problem has
        been corrected.
           2.)  To keep the flux scale from drifting when the
        program solves for full complex gains, I now compute the
        mean modulus of the antenna gains, over the entire run.
        Before the data are corrected, the gains are re-scaled so
        that the mean modulus of the gains which are finally used
        is equal to unity.
           3.)  If you don't want to believe rather wild ampli-
        tude solutions, there is a new option for you.  Set
        BPARM(9) to a positive number.  A new subroutine, called
        GEDIT, then will keep track of the (running) mean modulus
        of the antenna gain solutions, and when the modulus of a
        gain solution differs from the running mean (over all
        i.f.'s) modulus by more than BPARM(9) standard deviations
        GEDIT will mark that i.f. as bad.

        I revised the subroutine GETMOD to read (via SUMARY) the
        new format CC extension file.  I added a new option,
        INVER, to select the version number of the CC file.
        The helps and inputs files in TEST.HELP and TEST.INPUTS
        have been revised accordingly.  I also added a brief note
        on the new gain solution routine in the helps and inputs
        files.  I also removed the COMMON labeled /WRK, since
        its function was only to shoehorn the program in on the
        Modcomp.  Probably the shoehorning can be done over
        again without the need for this labeled common.

  364.  Sept. 13, 1981          ASCAL                  Fred
           I inserted new versions of GCALC and GCALC1.
           GCALC had a minor error (a CONTINUE statement out of
        place) that was introduced in trying to improve the
        typing.  This error should have had no major effect ex-
        cept to slow the rate of convergence, and, perhaps, to
        cause a bit of trouble in marginal cases.  I also
        changed GCALC so that now, instead of fitting model(i,j)
        to g(j)*conjg(g(i))*obs(i,j), it fits obs(i,j) to
        g(i)*conjg(g(j))*model(i,j) (and returns the recipro-
        cals of the correction factors).
           GCALC1 now is able to solve for full complex gains
        as well as just for phase corrections.  I also made the
        phase solution algorithm a bit more efficient.  Most of
        the work now is done in double-precision.  Some of the
        complex double-precision may cause a problem later in
        transporting the routine to the Modcomp or the 360.
        This stuff could easily be done in real arithmetic, but
        after a bit more testing I may go back to single prec.
        GCALC1 needs more work -- it seems to work reliably, but
        still is a bit slow.
           I also updated the HELPS file.
           These changes were made only in the TEST area on the
        CV Vax.
