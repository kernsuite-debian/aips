                 Changes while 31DEC08 is TST

***********************************************************************
***********************************************************************

12511.  December 2, 2007      New version                        Eric
        Put new version string in GETRLS, INSTEP1, install.pl,
        update.pl, ZXHLP2.PL, UPDCONTROL, AIPSPATH.SH, AIPSPATH.CSH.
        Moved nowhere.

12512.  December 2, 2007           Accounting                    Eric
        Created DSUMIO.INC and put it in ZMIO, ZFIO, ZMSGDK, ACOUNT
        to sum read/write counts and bytes.  The accounting will
        report the IO in Mbytes.
        Moved nowhere.

12513.  December 5, 2007          RECAT                 Eric
        Added code to the stand-alone program RECAT to detect that it
        is being run as a task and to forbid that.
        Moved to NEW this date.

12514.  December 7, 2007        VLARUN                           Lorant
        Added a check for long (>12 char) source names, typical when
        planets are FILLMed without CPARM(2)>=16, or for mozaic fields
        with the same name (and occasional long IRAS/CXO etc entries).
        VLARUN will warn that it won't run and allow to do a quick fix
        using an included procedure to shorten the names automatically.
        Moved nowhere.

12515.  December 10, 2007       IMEAN, IMST              Eric
        Changed IMEAN to add DOINV adverb.  Changed AU6D (IMSTAT verb)
        to match the handling of circular apertures in floating point
        rather than integer cells and AU8A (verb EXTLIST) for new
        adverb in IMEAN.
        Moved nowhere.

12516.  December 10, 2007        install.pl              Eric
        MACINT was missing from the list of extra architectures for
        which diretories must be created.  It was also missing from
        the MAC case issue when making a link file named AIPS as well
        as the one named aips.
        Moved fixes to NEW this date.

12517.  December 11, 2007         I/O accounting            Eric
        Changed DSUMIO.INC, ZFIO, ZMIO, ZMSGDK, ACOUNT to count ZFIO
        and ZMIO I/O counts separately.  If DBGAIP > 0, ACOUNT will
        report full details at the end.  DBGAIP is set by pseudoverb
        SETD and any value < 10 will be meaningless as far as debug is
        concerned.
        Moved nowhere.

12518.  December 19, 2007        RMSD                       Leonia
        The number of RMS used at the multi iterational calculating
        of the final RMS has been fixed to 3. Now it is under control
        of input parameter SCAL3. The help file is updated.
        Moved nowhere.

12519.  December 25, 2007           VLBAEOPS              Eric
        Cleaned up typing of help file.  Lines were too long causing
        them to be truncated for the user displays, etc.
        Moved to 31DEC07 this date.

12520.  December 28, 2007        AIPSLetter                Eric
        Released LET07B.{TEX,PS,PDF} for 31DEC07 final revision.
        Moved nowhere ($AIPSPUBL is in all versions).

12521.  December 28, 2007          CookBook                Eric
        Changed $SYSUNIX/AIPSWC to include more areas and count PDF to
        skip.
        Changed chapters:
        1    Updated line and task counts, shipping info, mailing
             address, aips++ info, etc.
        3    Comments re message server, Web and street addresses,
             REBYTE mention.
        4    FILLM (corr coef), TYSMO/TYAPL, TAPPE, OUTFGVER, CLIPM ->
             CLIP, WIPER, VLANT, FITAB changed, VLACALIB does models
        5    Numerous wording changes - esp CLIP usage different,
             EDITR has FLAGVER and OUTFGVER, IMAGR has two new menu
             options, new OOSUB mentioned.  Weights from FILLM are
             good not poor as stated.  WIPER more general now with
             baselines known.
        6    Numerous wording changes - esp TVLOD FUNCTYPEs, CORER
             calibration added, COPIXEL error return, IMEAN doinver.
        7    IMCENTER, IMEAN, reword some
        8    Wording changes, CUBIT, TAPPE, UVLSF
        9    DBCON does NOT fix antenna numbering (fixed several
             errors on this point).  Numerous wording/typo fixes.
             UVCOP now does NX tables.  VLBA verb in MkIII section.
             TYSMO added.  LISTR corrected.  OUTFGVER with UVFLG.
             Drop SLIME.  Add WEIGHTIT in CALIB self-cal section.
        10   Wording improvements, time order for flagging, OUTFGVER
        11   Updated wording, FITAB
        12   Tab completion, COPIXEL, FUDGE, move data to new computer
             section incl REBYTE
        13   Updated every list to be sure
        A    OUTFGVER in UVFLG, add major section on VLARUN., use
             model in VLACALIB
        B    Tape -> archive disk files, FILLM parms now default,
             lots more rewrites incl SETFC.
        C    CLIP, OUTFGVER, UVCOP (NX table), numerous minor wording
             changes
        F    Dropped 9-track tape section, FITAB added some and
             31DEC07 change in it, fixed size of CL table
        Moved nowhere ($AIPSPUBL is in all versions).

12522.  December 29, 2007          CookBook                Eric
        Changed chapters:  LaCook*.tex in $DOCTXT, COOK*.PS in
        $AIPSPUBL.  Copies in ftp site.
        0   Updated
        D   Add SNFLG, correct INDXR remark, emphasize models, VLANT,
            correct editing of SN tables (EDITA does not, CLCOR does
            CL), other re-wordings.
        I   Updated
        J   Updated
        Recipe chapter rearranged and reorganized as needed.
        $AIPSPUBL/COOKBOOK.PDF replaced as well as the full html
        version.
        Moved nowhere ($AIPSPUBL is in all versions).

12523.  December 31, 2007            LISTR                Eric
        Made FREQID apply to gain listings too, but allow all freq-id
        adverbs <= 0 to mean do all.
        moved nowhere.

12524.  January 2, 2008            FILLM                  Eric
        Correct time computation in FLMPO - no longer needs to
        subtract half the integration time.
        Changed averaging to average all parameters written to TY, PO,
        OF, WX, and OT files and changed those routines to write the
        average values.
        Changed way averaging decides when is enough so that an
        integration time or an elapsed time exceeding the requested
        ends the integration.  Previously it was only elapsed time and
        so could give, for example, 5-sample integrations when the
        requested time was exactly 4 times the sample interval.
        Changed default table sampling so that it will come out as the
        data sampling.
        Changed $APLUNIX/ZTPOP2.C to try 12 times with delays of 60
        seconds to open the on-line disk.  Previously it tried 100
        times with a delay of 100 seconds!  It also did not quit when
        it detected a request for on-line with a version not capable
        of such although it would report that every 100 seconds for
        9900 seconds.
        Changed MCSUM to check if the current, already begun,
        integration has any valid data at the start of the next sample
        to be included.  If not, then the integration is restarted.
        This led to short integrations with incorrect average times
        previously.
        Changed CL table writing to use average elevation and antenna
        delays and OR'ed OTT bit.  It was possible for CL table
        writing to be called with AVGIAT not yet averaged so time
        could be very wrong.  Corrected this
        Moved nowhere.

12525.  January 2, 2008              ZCPU                 Eric
        CLK_TCK is not easily defined in leopard - add a fix to the
        $APLMACIN version.
        Moved nowhere.

12526.  January 2, 2008              AIPS                  Eric
        Updated the copyright.
        Moved nowhere.

12527.  January 2, 2008          IMLOD, FITLD            Eric
        The default reference pixel is 0.0 not the center of the
        image.  Changed only the IMLOD portion of FITLD.
        Moved nowhere.

12528.  January 3, 2008              RMSD                  Leonia
        Add an option using circle instead of the box surrounding
        the pixel to evaluate RMS.
        Moved nowhere.

12529.  January 4, 2008      IMLOD, FITLD, UVLOD         Eric
        Added defenses against strings with null bytes in tables and
        elsewhere.  Changed also RWTAB and R3DTAB.
        Moved nowhere.

12530.  January 4, 2008           UVDIF                  Eric
        Changed it to ignore differences in random parameters so long
        as the essentials all work okay.
        Moved nowhere.

12531.  January 7, 2008         XAS, START_AIPS           Wes/Eric
        The new Mac operating system "leopard" has a clever scheme in
        which $DISPLAY is set to a named pipe of for
        "/tmp/gobbldegook" which confused aips significantly.  Made
        small changes to XAS.SHR (init.c) and START_AIPS and
        START_TVSERVERS.
        Moved nowhere.

12532.  January 9, 2008           VLANT                   Eric
        Moved the - I hope - completed VLA station corrections file
        for 2007 to $AIPSTARS and saw to a dummy 2008 file being
        created in the appropriate mysterious places.
        Moved nowhere, but 31dEC07 gets it automatically.

12533.  January 9, 2008           REBYTE                 Eric
        The table translation made a hash of tables with long rows -
        IM tables from VLBI and potentially BP tables for significant
        numbers (~ 120 or so) of channels times IFs.
        Moved to 31DEC07 this date.

12534.  January 9, 2008           FILLM                  Eric
        Changed
        1. FILLM was able to miss changes of mode or number of
        spectral channels if they occurred at file boundaries.
        Added additional parameters to catch them.
        2. Added option v (13'th bit) to CPARM(2) which says to write
        an OF table in any case.  Set IF table parameter WANTOF to
        true is shadow flagging is suppressed or < 25 meters, if Tsys
        variable flagging is suppressed or if warning level flagging
        set higher than 3 (CPARM(3)).
        3. Add parameters MCSTAT being the array status and AVSTAT
        being the logical OR of the MCSTATs.
        4. Changed format of OF table, changing DOFV.INC, OFINI, TABOF
        and the calling areas in FILLM.  Changed it to write the OF
        table only when a flag or status is non zero.  Perhaps we
        should write the OF table all the time.
        Moved nowhere.

12535.  January 10, 2008          PRTOF                   Eric
        NEW TASK: prints the contents of an OF table.  Help could
        probably use a bit more explain.
        Moved nowhere.

12536.  January 10, 2008         VLBAUTIL                 Amy
        Changed the default CLINT to 0.25, seemed more rational for the
        default CLINT to be at the low end of the range that should
        probably be used rather than the high end (1 minute).  Also
        changed INDXR input that set the max time gap (CPAMR(1)) to 1
        whenever INDXR is run.  The default in INDXR is 10 minutes
        which seems long.  Changed the following help files to reflect
        the CLINT default change: VLBAFIX.HLP, VLBAFQS.HLP, VLBALOAD.HLP,
        VLBASRT.HLP and VLBASUBS.HLP.
        Moved nowhere.

12537.  January 11, 2008           PRTOF                   Eric
        Enhance the correctness and information content of the help
        file and the header comments in the Fortran.
        Moved nowhere.

12538.  January 15, 2007   START_AIPS START_TVSERVERS      Eric
        Solaris could not handle the grammar we put in for Macs.
        Changed to skip some statements when Solaris.
        Moved nowhere.

12539.  January 16, 2008         UVDIF                   Eric
        Added APARM(6) to allow for comparing fully flagged data and
        changed code to ignore fully flagged data unless APARM(6) is
        at least 1.
        Moved nowhere.

12540.  January 16, 2008             OFLAG                Eric
        New task: applies OF table selectively to write a FG table.
        It can copy an existing table and append the new flags.
        Moved nowhere.

12541.  January 17, 2008          TABED                   Eric
        Implemented CLIP, DELE, UFLG options and cleaned up the code
        typing a whole lot.
        Moved nowhere.

12542.  January 18, 2008            FITLD                  Eric
        Corrected errors I put in the call sequence to TABWR so that
        weather tables can be properly interpreted.  Included use of
        the number of parameters to handle weather tables missing WVR
        and ION values.
        Added more OPCODE options to allow the correlator tables to be
        retained and/or the VT table.
        Moved WR fix to patch, rest nowhere.

12543.  January 19, 2008         SNEDT, EDITA, EDITR       Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL, the EDIT class routine, to handle flagged
        table rows properly (rather than qutting for error), to get a
        proper ANTMAX for TY tables even though they do not have a
        NO_ANT keyword, and to perform "restore area" with the same
        complicated logic as flag area (it was restoring all times in
        the box ignoring the amplitude window).
        Moved nowhere.

12544.  January 21, 2008             WIPER                 Eric
        Added options FLAG BASELIN and UNFLAG BASEL - changes task to
        interactive with slow return to aips since we have to read the
        baseline numbers from the terminal.  Changed the number of
        baselines remembered to 10 although only 2+ can be displayed.
        If a baseline is flagged that is known at each point where it
        occurs even if that does not flag the displayed point (because
        of other valid data there).  Changed help and real-time help.
        Moved nowhere.

12545.  January 23, 2008           SNEDT et al            Eric
        Forgot to COMRPL QEDIUTIL so the changes of Jan 19 did not get
        made until today.
        Moved nowhere.

12546.  January 24, 2008           APCAL                  Amy
        Added a couple checks of the WX table in case it is corrupt.
        The FITLD bug that was recently fixed corrupted the WX table so
        that no rows were read from the WX table, for this I put in an
        error message.  I also check if any temperatures are read in
        for an antenna and if not, print a message for that.
        Moved nowhere.

12547.  January 24, 2008           VPLOT                  Eric
        Create new adverb AVGCHAN, changing POPSDAT, NEWPARMS, and
        AU2A and writing a new help file.  Added adverbs AVGCHAN and
        CROWDED to VPLOT.  The former says whether to treat spectral
        channels individually or as a single vector average and the
        latter controls whether the IFs and channels appear all
        together in each panel or in separate panels.
        Moved nowhere.

12548.  January 25, 2008            TVFLG                 Eric
        Added the adverb options NCHAVG and CHINC.  Required a change
        to the call sequence and functions in GRIDTB and a new useful
        subroutine UNFRMT.  The latter is REFRMT except with an added
        symbol to say 0 blanks desired at this point (used for a range
        of channels such as 11-13).  Lots of minor changes throughout
        TVFLG for these options.  UVIMG needed a change to handle the
        new GRIDTB call sequence.
        Moved nowhere.

12459.  January 25, 2008             VPLOT                Eric
        Corrected to draw colored connecting lines when requested.
        Also found a few more places where the multi-channel option
        was not fully implemented.
        Moved nowhere.

12550.  January 27-28, 2008         VPLOT                 Eric
        Changed it to try to avoid phase plots that scale -180 to 180
        when something like 100 to 200 would do.
        28th - added adjust phase on fixed plot where min >= 0.
        Moved nowhere.

12551.  January 28, 2008       UVPLT, WIPER                Eric
        Changed:
        1. Make phase plots try to avoid the -180 to 180 where
        possible.
        2. The self-scale within a fixed range was not implemented.
        3. Found binned plots (UVPLT only) did not average phase as a
        vector.  Changed to allow 4096 bins and to do vector binning
        for phase.
        Moved nowhere.

12552.  January 28, 2008          BPLOT                    Eric
        Changed to avoid any phase wrap issues if possible.
        Moved nowhere.

12553.  January 30, 2008       EDITA, EDITR              Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL to be more aware of which antennas have data
        rather than just those that are allowed to have data.  Changed
        it to choose the better phase plot range and convert the data
        to that range.  Added routine to attempt to put phases in the
        user-specifed range if possible.

12554.  January 30, 2008     VLBATECR, VLATECR          Amy
        There was a small error in VLBATECR and VLATECR in calculating
        how many files to download to cover the entire timerange of the
        experiments.  Only projects observed before 2003 with day numbers
        larger than 305 would have been effected.

12555.  February 1, 2008            MFPRT                 Eric
        Changed:
        1. Added print or sorted row number with new adverb FORMAT to
           suppress it if desired.
        2. Added OPTYPE 'USER' to allow the user to select rows with
           BOX using appropriate formats for the columns.
        3. Added OPTYPE 'LIDE' to do LIST with deconvolved widths
           instead of fit ones.
        4. Added OPTYPEs LINE and CONT to force the default style
           printing to be that for multi- and single-channel images
           respectively.
        5. Changed to symbolic column numbers from include PMFC.
        6. Changed line display to omit velocities when they cannot be
           computed.
        7. Omitted code for unused time columns.
        8. Corrected the line flux cutoff to use total flux column
           (like the others) rather than peak brightnes.
        Moved nowhere.

12556.  February 1, 2008             TVFLG               Eric
        Found bug in GRIDTB introduced when I added the NCHAVG and
        CHINC options.  It messed up Stokes QU and RLLR.

12557.  February 4, 2008            MFPRT                 Eric
        Corrected scaling of X and Y offsets when DOHMS=1- - they were
        left in degrees.  Added "column" 40 to USER - as the computed
        velocity from the header and plane column (1).

12558.  February 4, 2008            RMSD                 Leonia
        The histogram concept for calculation of RMS has been added.
        The new input adverb OPTYPE is added to switch the old concept
        and the histogram concept. The histogram is built at
        the range of the input data +-1.5sigma, near the maxinum
        position. The histogram has 16 intervals. Non linear least square
        method is used to fit Gaussian into the histogram.
        The initial parameters for this fitting:
        SIGMA, MAXPOS are calculated using the old concept of the RMS
        calculation. The initial value for the Gaussian maximum is
        estimated as maximum of the histogram. The three initial
        parameters of the Gaussian are actually calculated only for the
        first pixel of each row.
        The relevant values of the previous pixel are used as initial
        Gaussian parameters for the other pixels.

12559.  February 4, 2008            FILLM               Eric
        Changed to take advantage of the new bandcode available in the
        subarray data area.  Now, two frequencies from the same
        receiver will be treated as the same band even if one lies in
        the formal frequency of another.

12560.  February 4, 2008           TV memories          Eric
        It would seem that more TV memories would be useful.  Changing
        to 8 memory planes.  Changed:
        TVDEVICE   TVMOVIE   AU6      GETOFM   TVFIDL   COLORC  ILNCLR
        SPFLG      TVFLG     IBLED
        to copy the first NLEVS values into repeated parts of the OFM
        up to 8.  Tasks TVHXF and TVHLD are build to do 256 levels
        only and zero the OFM above that.  Raised the buffer sizes in
        them so that things will not die for that reason.
        MUCH MORE is coming.
        Moved nowhere.

12561.  February 9, 2008            RMSD                  Leonia
        The last RMSD version has not worked with the special Frazer's
        data which have many zeros at the each row begin. So the task
        codes were modified:
        1. The task started calculating SIGMA with the first pixel
           at each row. Now it starts with the pixel where SIGMA.NE.0
        2. The double precision version of the least square routine
           is used instead of previously used single precision one.
        3. Several conditions added to exclude the failure inside of
           of the least square routine.
        Moved nowhere.

12562.  February 12, 2008          RMSD                    Leonia
        The double precision version of the Least square routine
        has been attached to the RMSD to control
        "matrix is inconsistent..". Now the solution for SIGMA is
        zeroed if it happens. That allows to circumwent bad solutions
        which can occur at the case of bad data (more zeros for
        example). The least square solution is considered bad under
        the following new condition: IF(SIGMA.LE.0 .OR. MAXIMU.LE.2).
        The previos condition IF(SIGMA.LE.1.E-7) may create a problem
        if the data consist mainly of the very small numbers.
        So the new version can more succesfully fight with the very
        special data: many zeros, histogram is two far from a
        Gaussian....

12563.  February 25, 2008        APCAL                  Amy
        Format error in a print statement.  Caused APCAL to croak
        on certain computers, but always wrote the wrong thing in the
        history file.
        Moved nowhere.

12564.  March 3, 2008          TV memory              Eric
        Changed TV memory in XAS to allow 16 memories and image
        intensities to 8191 and outputs from the LUT of 2046.  A
        serious attempt has been made (using new opcodes) to allow
        older releases of code to talk to 31DEC08 XAS.  The reverse
        will not work.  Changes to XAS include:
        1. To make NGREY a local variable and NGREYMAX=16 a defined
           thing that controls the size of the image catalog and
           various other arrays.  Ngrey may be reset with .Xdefaults.
        2. catalog.c - changed error in find operation in which the
           1st character was tested twice rather than testing the 2nd
           character
        3. colors.c - changed lut read/write to 16 bit, saving old
           routines under new names using 256 values.  Made new name
           copies of ofm read/write to use 1024 values rather than
           FNINTENS.  cmap_split also changed to use 16-bit data and
           to have old 8-bit clone under new name.
        4. image.c - Cloned old image read/write routines and made new
           ones under the old names to handle 16-bit pixel data.
           Changed Interogate to return the desired new intensity
           values and made clone of old one with new name to return
           old values.  Made clones with new name for fill and vector
           routines with revised using 16-bit data.  Changed both to
           call Init routines if the type changes.
        5. init.c - NValue, NColour now 8192 not 256.  Show user max
           intensity and number gray planes.  Image memory now short
           int in allocation.  New name for plane_data when must be 8
           bit.  OFM setting done more generally, LUT no longer
           assumes out = in.  Colour table not needed for 24-bit and
           now too small so comment out.  Made new opcode to clone the
           INIT function so that we init with 4 Ngrey for old and 16
           for new with different default LUT and OFM scalings.
        6. screen.c - plane_short where using 8-bit plane data.
        7. xas.c - add to case statement all "old" functions now under
           new names.  Correct return bytes.
        8. xas.h - NINTENS now 2046 (note 2048*16 gives I/O touble),
           FNINTENS now explicitly NGREYMAX*NINTENS, buffers bigger,
           plane data short int not unsigned char, new opcode names
           for old functions and new opcode values for old names,
           declare new subroutines.
        Z routines:
        ZSSSO2   Raise work buffer size to 32768
        ZSSSX2   Raise work buffer size to 32768
        ZSSSC2   Raise work buffer size to 32768
        $YSS routines:
        YCNECT   Changed code from 25 to 28, to 16-bit data
        YFILL    Changed code from 23 to 27, to 16-bit data
        YIMGIO   Changed codes from 21 and 22 to 19 and 20, changed to
                 16-bit data
        YINIT    Changed code from 15 to 29 to invoke new InitXAS.
        YLUT     Changed codes from 41 and 42 to 39 and 40, changed to
                 16-bit data.
        YOFM     Changed to codes 37 and 38 and raised size of local
                 buffer to 32768.
        YSPLIT   Changed code to 48 from 47 and data from 8-bit to
                 16-bit
        Moved nowhere.

                 TVCORN, and TVXY as system adverbs with locally
                 controlled max values.
        AU2      As AU1A

        AU5A     To load images in a more general fashion for TVROAM,
                 to ignore SETROAM, and to make the TV channels used
                 be 1 - N where N is the number of frames up to 16.
                 Drop DECBIT calls.
        TVROAM   To allow 16 memories max and to stay in sensible
                 order (previously went in a circle in 2x2).  ROMODE
                 now 100 * Nx + Ny.
        TVWIND   To be more general in analyzing roam requirements

        AU2A     TVLEVS default now 0.
        TVDEVICE Use graphics scroll, not TVSCRX/Y; set YOFM data more
                 generally [loop to (OFMINP+1)/NLEVS], insure through
                 PTVC that the OFM buffer is adequate and use it in
                 OFM function calls everywhere.  Changed TVDFUN to
                 default TVCHAN using all 4 quadrants.
        TVALUE   Use graphics scroll, not TVSCRX/Y

                 buffer sizes with PTVC, drop DECBIT silly usage.
                 Drop GRCHAN adverb and use graphics which are on.
        TVMOVI   Bigger local OFM buffer using PTVC, general copy form
        AU6      As TVMOVI.  Change meaning of TVCHAN by dropping
                 DECBIT and rearranging code.  TVLEVS defaults to
                 LUTOUT+1 for <10 and old value 256.  Changed handling
                 of TVCHAN 0 to check all 4 quadrants for channels
                 that are on.
        TVFIDL   As TVMOVI
        AU5E     Bigger local buffer to manage OFM subroutines.

        COLORH   Corrected size of local OFM buffer, dropped unused
                 call argument buffer
        SPFLG    Copy form for OFM, argument to TVPSUD
        TVFLG    Copy form for OFM, argument to TVPSUD
        GETOFM   General copy form to build up OFM, local buffer of
                 right size using PTVC - changed call sequence!
        KNTR     GETOFM call seq
        GREYS    GETOFM call seq
        PCNTR    GETOFM call seq
        LWPLA    GETOFM call seq
        TVPL     GETOFM call made no sense and should have done
                 nothing - removed it.  Also removed DECBIT call and
                 changed handling of TVCHAN to try to accomodate
                 3-color if it occurs.
        AU5      Drop DECBIT, change TVON et al to bit pattern on
                 channel from stack.  Default TVCHAN for TVCLEAR to
                 check all quadrants.
        AU5B     Add GR2CHAN to control background color in TVANOT.
                 Drop DECBIT and some mod's by 10 on GRCHAN.
        AU5D     Dropped DECBIT on TVCHAN setting.
        AU5F     Add GR2CHAN to eliminate decimal coding.
        AU6A     Add GR2CHAN and TV2CHAN to eliminate decimal coding;
                 TVLEVS defaults to LUTOUT+1 for <10 and old value
                 256.  Use PTVC to insure LUTBUF big enough.
        AU6C     Drop DECBIT in TVFIDDLE.
        HIENH    Drop DECBIT, set bit patterns and local values,
                 PTVC to set LUT size

        The cross correlation of the two given images has been added
        under control of OPCODE=IMAC.
        The convolution of the two images is calculated if OPCODE=IMAG
        (as it was previously).
        Nothing is changed to add the cross correlation of the given
        image with GAUSSIAN, because convollution and cross correlation
        should be coincided at this case. (GAUSSIAN is a symmetric
        function.)

12568.  March 3, 2008         more TV                   eric
        Changed in testing:
        1. AIPS, AU1A, AU2 - the TV opens too slowly sometimes so
           moved the TVOPEN in AIPS to after the user number and added
           if NGRAPH <= 0 TVOPENs in AU1A and AU2.  All 3 are in
           message suppression state to hide failures.
        2. G3VCOL used 255 rather than MAXINT!
        3. GETOFM - change to return number values, TVMLOU from TV,
                    whatever from text
           G3SCAL - add argument to give dimension of OFM (TVMLOU
                    normally)
           KNTR, GREYS, PCNTR, LWPLA - change ROFM etc dimension, add
                 argument to G3SCAL amd GETOFM
        4. AU5E, AU6, AU6C - changed TVLEVS to be > LUTOUT only.
           Changed help for OFFPSEUD, OFMCONT, TVALL, TVFIDDLE,
           TVLEVS, TVPHLAME, TVPSEUD.
        5. Fell into my own trap with TVALL - fixed immediate arg to
           TVON two places in POPSDAT.
        6. Typo in TVFLG too.
        7. Upgraded XAS.SHR and ZSSSO2 to match on buffer list.

        Did not remember to COMRPL 2 of the changed subroutines.  I
        thought I had done all, but seemingly not.  Also DGPH.INC has
        a parameter to keep track of channels that are on and it
        needed to go to at least 24 from 16.  GINIT inits it too.

12570.  March 4, 2008       model division               Eric
        The correct weights after model division are multiplied by
        amplitude squared, not amplitude.  The gridded modeling was
        corrected years ago, but the DFT was not until today.
        Fixed QPTDIV, QGADIV, and QSPDIV.
        Moved to 31DEC07 patch March 5.

12571.  March 4, 2008          more TV                   Eric
        $YGEN versions of YCURSE and YCUCOR made reference to the
        channel scroll and were not fixed to use the new variable for
        graphics channel scroll.  This messed up interactive routines
        some places, esp WIPER.

12572.  March 5, 2008             FILLM                 Eric
        FILLM has been scaling and weighting cross-hand data
        incorrectly in those cases in which the antenna order in the
        on-line system is reversed from the antenna order implied by
        the numbers painted on the sides of the telescope.   The
        reversal took place before the scaling and weighting and it
        must take place after since we cannot change the antenna
        numbers themselves.  Note that this affects ModComp-era data
        when converted to correlation coefficients and post-Modcomp
        data when converted to visibilities.  It affects weights of
        Modcomp-era data when not converted to correlation
        coefficients.  The affects on solar data cross-hands are
        more extensive since they are converted to correlation
        coefficients.  Note that this bug was found by George
        Moellenbrock in trying to understand problems in casa.
        Moved to 31DEC07 patch this date.

12573.  March 5, 2008              CONVL                Leonia
        The new option 'IMAC' at CONVL (#12567) requires array XTEMP.
        The dimension of this array was 1000 which is not enough
        for the image of bigger size (1024x1024 for example).
        So I have changed the dimension to the maximum allowed by
        AIPS: MAXIMG.

        Added messages to FACSET about source model usage in the
        presence of an SU table but 0 flux for the source.  One cannot
        use GETJY after setting gains in such a case.  Notes about

12577.  March 6, 2008          more TV                   Eric

        to use the aips message system for error messages rather than
        puting them out to stderr.  This way, they can be suppressed
        at level 7 and can be saved in the message file.

12578.  March 7, 2008            More TV!                Eric
        1. XAS: The output buffering was not large enough to read back
                OFMs.  The data read routine returned a misleading
                value - 0 or -1 are all that is allowed.  The
                parameters of tthe TV common were being handled in 16
                Bits - but TVLIMG now requires 24 - so change to 32,
                making an old version subroutine for saving 16-bit
                parameters.
        2. YDTVC: change to be 32 bit for parameters and change the
                save opcode.
        3. TVCPS: change the number of memories parameter to 16.
        4. SPFLG and TVFLG: parameterize the LUT size.  The CLIP
                INTERACTIVE function went nuts when the LUTs were too
                small.

12580.  March 11, 2008          LISTR                   Eric
        Added two gain cenversions EFST = effective system temperature

12582.  March 13, 2008           further TV             Eric
        TVFIND: Changed to specify what sort of image it is looking
                for - otherwise when asking for wedges it confuses

        A READ status was not put on the file for the new OPTYPEs and
        therefore also not removed.  Strangely, sometimes a READ
        status did appear and remain after LISTR was done.  Since this
        makes no sense, the correction to handle the new OPTYPEs like
        GAIN may or may not do something useful.

12586.  March 19, 2008       improve I/O count             Eric
        Imaging in the case of large numbers of facets and large UV
        data set sizes has become completely I/O bound.  I have begun
        a process of looking at the sources of that I/O.  One obvious
        fix to make is to reduce the usage of UVPROT which finds the
        maximum rotated UV value for 3D imaging.  It is called in
        ALGSTB but the rotation matrix is known only for one facet at
        a time, so UVPROT is called once for each facet in such tasks
        as CALIB and UVSUB.  Changed:
        DGDS.INC   Add array UMATS(3,3,MAXFLD), the uv rotation
                   matrix.
        UVPROT     Change call seq adding MFIELD (# fields), DISKO,
                   and CNOOUT (output uv data set to be written later)
                   and changing UMAT to UMATS.  Inside it computes the
                   max U over all fields if necessary (header keyword
                   MAXABSU <= 0 or absent) and writes that keyword to
                   the input and future output files.
        ALGSTB     Change call seq to UVPROT
        UVGRID     Change call seq to UVPROT - make sure out = in
                   UVPROT should never be called
        UVGRTB     Change call seq to UVPROT - make sure out = in
                   UVPROT should never be called
        SETGDS     Change call seq: add main data set disk, cno.
                   Find UV rotation from main header, compute UV
                   rotation matrix for each field in UMATS.  Fix it to
                   handle transposed RA/Dec.  Changed to read for
                   MAXABSU and change it to negative or 0 to force one
                   read through the data by UVPROT.
        Tasks getting new call sequence to SETGDS are: CLPLT, IBLED,
        VPLOT, BLCAL, BPASS, CALIB, CPASS, FRING, KRING, LPCAL, PCAL,
        UVADC, UVCON, UVSUB.
        SETDO3     Changed to record which data set was used and to
                   compute UMATS and to notice if it changed.  It
                   resets MAXABSU if the file changes and UMATS
                   changes.
        QUVUTIL    Changed call seq to SETDO3
        OOSUB      Error allowed EIF to be larger than present in the
                   data and led to loops over non-existent channels.

12588.  March 20, 2008           imaging              Eric
        BLCAL, BPASS, CALIB, CPASS, FRING, KRING call SETGDS twice -
        fix the 2nd call sequence.
        Fix SETGDS not to force UVPROT to do a read if UMATS does not
        change (like SETDO3).
        UVPROT changed to handle output disk from the SCR common
        (DISKO <= 0) which CALIB etc produce.
        Forced quick MNJ prep.

12589.  March 24, 2008     rethink pseudo AP             Eric

        PAPC.INC    Comment all old parameters, new one PSAPMN
                    set to 5120 kwords for minimum pseudo ap size
        DAPC.INC    Changed APCORE dimension from whatever PAPC
                    give (5 million usually) to 2, all that is needed
                    for dynamic memory addressing.  Saves 20 Mbytes.
        ZDCHIN      $APLGEN: Drop PAPC, default KAPWRD = 132*1024
                    kWords, read disk and if KAP2WD (value 69) > 0
                    or KAPWRD (value 11, was always 64) < 1024, then
                    reset values to defaults.  Added ZADRSZ call and
                    set limit to AP to 1536*1024 (6 Gbytes) for 64-bit
                    addressing machines.
        QINIT       $QPSAP: change to make allocated size
                        max (min (I, KAPWRD), PSAPMN)
                    Also cleaned up left-over comments
        QCLNSZ      $QPSAP: drop PAPC.INC, fix comments, calling will
                    need to do error tests.
        FILAIP      Use KAPWRD, drop PAPC and its parameters
        FILAI2      Use KAPWRD, drop PAPC and its parameters
        SETPAR      Drop secondary AP parameter, reword KAPWRD
                    parameter and set limits using ZADRSZ (1.5 or 6
                    Gbytes)
        SETSP       As SETPAR
        POPSDAT     Add verb SETMAXAP
        NEWPARMS    Add verb SETMAXAP
        AUC         Code new verb SETMAXAP: telss current values and
                    allowed range or updates the SP table.
        SETMAXAP    New help file for new verb.
        ALGSTB      Improve test on adequate pseudo-AP memory after
                    QINIT call.
        ALGSUB      Fixed typo'd message, require desired AP memory.
        GR3DUV      Dropped local limits, added tougher test
        GRIDUV      Dropped local limits, added tougher test

        VSCDFT      Dropped a limit, added a missing error test,
                    removed an erroneous use of the old KAPWRD
                    parameters
        QCLEAN      Found error: used APSIZE from DAPC common for the
                    current AP size - fixed to PSAPNW.  Improved QINIT
                    error handling, dropped limits.
        SDIMG       Changed what were supposed to be AP limits from
                    MAX to MIN and dropped first one.  Dropped
                    erroneous reference to KAPWRD, improved final
                    error message on QINIT.
        CXCLN       Made the QINIT error test check that we got
                    requested memory.
        Add error tests after QINIT call (not present previously):
        CONV     CORR     GRDCOR   GRDSUB   IMGMEM   UVUNIF
        BPASS    CVEL     SDVEL    CONPL
        Drop limits on AP size prior to call to QINIT which does that
        now and add or improve error tests:

        SETSP       Drop PAPC include.
        SETPAR      Drop PAPC include.
        KRING       Drop PAPC include: APSIZE used for no discernible
                    reason other than perhaps a guess as to machine
                    size.  Changed to KAPWRD * 1024.
        QINIT       $PSAP: added PAPC include since uses PSAPMN.

        The dynamic memory allocation depended on a guess of the
        number of times in the data set - a guess that could be too
        low.  Added code to count the times from the SN/CL table
        rather than guess.  Also put the time array into dynamic
        memory so there are no limits now for large SN tables.

12600.  March 31, 2008        gridded modeling            Eric
        Change things to allow gridded subtraction without use of
        scratch files when enough AP memory is available:
        QGRDCC     Changed so that GRD is both in and out
        CCSGRD     Changed the write APIO call to use the new output
                   address of QGRDCC
        UVMSUB     Comment out the GRDSET call - leave to GRDSUB.
        GRDSUB     Change the computation of the amount of AP memory
                   required to set a minimum and a desired.  If the
                   amount is >= desired, then call new routines
                   CCSMEM and ALGMEM rather than CCSGRD and ALGSTB or
                   ALGSUB.  Put the GRDSET call in GRDSUB rather than
        CCSMEM     New routine: grids/FFTs the Clean components
                   keeping full grid in AP memory.
        ALGMEM     New routine: ALGSTB but with CC grid in ram not
                   APIO and assume all fits well.
        UVPREP     New OPCODE = 'REED' -. open for read but do not

12601.  April 2, 2008       gridded subtraction            Eric
        Looking ahead to the hope that we can do more than one grid at
        a time in some cases, the recomputation of UVW for 3D and
        rotation and the setting of the data to be all at U >= 0 will
        need to be done in the AP to avoid moving buffers back and
        forth a lot (with compression possible!).  Changed:
        UVPREP   Forgot to issue the initial read on REED opcode.
        ALGMEM   Cleaned up code setting buffer size, move UVW changes
                 into AP and conjugate there too.
        GRDSUB   Raise the needed memory by one word per record for
                 the conjugate pointer

        When the cal system was added, we omitted a UVGET ('CLOS'
        which should appear in the loop over subarray.  This left LUN
        28 open so that the history file could not be written.

        Solution for the maximum position at the output data is added.
        The subroutine POL2DI fits the two dimensional polinom
        (including the XY term) by least square method in the output
        data. The selected box (IMSIZE) of the output data is used.
        Then the found coefficients of the polinom are recalculated
        in the X0,Y0 position of the maximum (and the value of
        the maximum itself).

12604.  April 8, 2008            TV verbs                Eric
        The new code and some older stuff was not careful to close the
        TV when errors occurred.  Then the TV could not be accessed
        again.  Fixed error branches in AU5F, AU6A, AU6D, and a
        message in AU6E.

12605.  April 9, 2008            CALIB                   Eric
        Changed default of CPARM(1) to -100 degrees for an elevation
        cutoff for determining the average amplitude gain.  Otherwise,
        for data where "time" is actually hour angle, the "elevations"
        for good solutions could be negative.  CPARM(1), when set and
        when mean gain will be constrained, functions as it should.
        Changed the DOFLAG write-up in the help file to be a bit more
        self-evident.

12606.  April 18, 2008             IMAGR                Eric
        Changed UVWAIT to do summing with double precision vaiables.
        Summing large numbers of small numbers can lose accuracy once
        the sum gets to 10 million or so - the small numbers no longer
        change the sum even if there are still a large number of small
        numbers to go.  Perhaps this explaains why some uniform
        weighting schemes seem to improve noise over natural!

12607.  April 21, 2008      misc, EDITR                   Eric
        Changed QUVUTIL and QEDIUTIL to remove references to APCORE
        that were purely useless comments - I'm tired of greps turning
        these up.  Also dropped unused include DAPC.INC from IMAGR,
        WFCLN, and FRING.  FRING did need DAPM.INC.
        Changed QEDIUTIL to match SOURCE to the sources in the SU
        table.  It lost contact with the source name/number when a
        single source was loaded from a multi-source file.  This led
        to the name of source 1 appearing in the editing displays and
        source number 1 appearing in the flag table when one-source
        was requested even when the source number was really something
        else.

12608.  April 24, 2008         CONVL                      Leonia
        Changed default for IMSIZE: the size of the box determined
        the data used at fitting of the parabola. It was 9, 9.
        Now it is 5, 5. The English at the output message is improved.

        Try to reduce the amount of IO by making gridded models have
        more than one model available in the AP at a time.
        Find order of facets matters, order of computation in gridding
        matters.  We could fix that with R*8 but then the computation
        would go a bit slower and would have half the available words
        in the AP.
        QGRDCC     Fix precursor comments - they were not changed as
                   intended.
        DMOD.INC   New include for multi-facet and/or multi-channel
                   model parameters
        MODFIT     New subroutine to see how many channels and/or
                   facets can be made to fit in the max allowed AP.
                   Prefers N channel groups with all facets, else will
                   do N channels w 1 facet if necessary or all
                   channels with M facets preferably.
        GRDSUB     If # models = 0, set up the DMOD common to do as
                   many as possible (assumes 1 spectral channel group
                   only - see PBUTIL below).  Loops doing as many
                   facets at a time as possible.  Changed call seq to
                   CCSGRD and CCSMEM and ALGMEM.
        CCSGRD     Drop channel argument which was unused.
        CCSMEM     Change call seq - add NCHAN.  Set up DMOD if not
                   already set to contain only 1 model as given by the
                   subroutine args.  Do a loop over the models setting
                   up all the grids.
        ALGMEM     Change call seq dropping field, channel, and nchan.
                   Precompute projection matrices for all fields in
                   DMOD lists, loop over models within the loop over
                   data computing and reloading AP parameter memory as
                   needed (when field or freq changes between models).
        QCLEAN     Change CLNUV1 (overlap < 2, do3d true) to do all
                   cleans then UVSUBM for all planes at once.
                   Previously did the UVSUBM inside the loop 1 plane
                   at a time.
        PBUTIL     PBFSUB: get more info MODCCEND, MODMETH, LREC to
                   allow decisions about components to subtract, list
                   frequency groups rather than doing on fly, for
                   gridded CC call MODFIT, create groups of CC tables
                   (potentially many for each facet) in DMOD.INC and
                   let OUMSUB do the work, then clean up.  Leave the
                   one channel at a time code in case it is needed.
                   PBFDIV: as PBFSUB but must do all facets even if
                   it means fewer channels in a pass.
                   PBFCCT: remember the spectral index for the CCs
                   where possible to avoid having to reread the images
                   all the time.
        UVMDIV     Change to use DMOD to determine the channels for
                   the call to UVDOUT.

12610.  April 29, 2008         DFT modeling                 Eric
        VISDFT found the model type from the first facet, first
        component and then ignored any model types not matching
        without comment.  Changed it to check all facets and to use
        Gaussian or Sphere for point models if there are also Gaussian
        or Sphere models.  It will complain if both Gaussians and
        Spheres occur, but points can be either with 0 width.  It
        takes more space and computing, but this is better than
        ignoring most of the flux!
        Moved to 31DEC07 this date.

12611.  April 29, 2008            FILLM                     Eric

12612.  May 1, 2008            Color plots                  Eric
        G3VCOL used MAXINT to scale the requested colors, but that
        parameter is not set when the TV is not actually used.  This
        means that color plot files were all black, which is not
        entirely useful.  The corresponding point in TVPL remained a
        hard-coded 255.0 which caused TVPL plots to be 1/32 as bright
        as they should be.  The former error appeared on March 3 of
        this year.

12613.  May 2, 2008               TVPL                     Eric
        TVPL has an array to keep track of what planes are on.  It was
        dimensioned 16 which no longer works - there are 16
        grey-scales plus 8 grpahics.  Fixed it to 32.  This caused it
        not to turn on graphics planes that it was using.
        Moved nowhere.

12614.  May 5, 2008             imaging                     Eric
        Changed things to allow DFT subtraction/division to work on
        more than one spectral channel (group) at a time.  This will
        help in IMAGR and OOSUB when applying channel-dependent
        corrections for primary beam and spectral index.  Changed:
        GRDMEM    Make frequency handling variables all double
                  precision as much as possible to avoid optimizers
                  reducing intended precision
        ALGMEM    As GRDMEM
        MODFIT    Changed call sequence to allow input and output
                  subtraction methods.  Now calls QMTYP so must move
                  to $QSUB.  Has method for DFT as well as GRID.
        GRDSUB    Changed the call to MODFIT forcing GRID.
        PBUTIL    PBFSUB: changed to allow DFT and GRID possibilities
                  in call to MODFIT, to force the resulting choice,
                  to order the models in MODFIT with facet number in
                  the inner loop altough the computations are with
                  frequency in the inner loop, to use new call seq for
                  PBFCCT: New call sequence to include range of CCs to
                  be subtracted/divided this time.  It now computes
                  the corrected CCs only for that range although it
                  must make a full CC table for each version.
        CCSMEM    If it sets MODMAX it must reset it to 0.
        VISDFT    To use pre-existing DMOD.INC parameters or set them
                  locally, to determine groups of facets with the same
                  frequency and handle them together. to use MODCCB
                  since NSUBG(field#) gets reset the first time that
                  field is accessed.  Thus it helps to have facet
                  number vary more rapidly than channel number.

        If the first record of a new scan contained an antenna not in
        the previous scan, subroutine GET3DT would write CL entries
        for that antenna for the previous scan.  Furthermore, if an
        antenna only occurred in the first record of a scan, then CL
        entries for that antenna and scan would not appear.  The
        former led to error messages from the software correlator that
        did not provide useless IM table entries for the antenna that
        was not used.

        Apparently this subroutine can cinfuse optimizing compilers.
        Added it to OPTIMIZE.LIS as a no-optimize.  UVSUB went nuts

        confusing.

        Added automatic creation of NX tables to these tasks.  SPLAT
        really requires it when making a multi-source output.  But an
        NX table in a single-source file can help CALIB do a better
        job of averaging within scans.

        The addition of the SOLMODE option to the procedure was made
        with incorrect POPS grammar: I used != when <> is correct.

        facets, even when there was only one.  Error made March 25.

        Code got rearranged apparently so that the multiplier that set
        u,v,w to the correct value was reset to 1.0 before
        application.  The uvw should now be a proper function of
        channel and IF.

12621.  May 29, 2008         fix Alias                  Eric
        The VLA using the old correlator has problems on EVLA-EVLA
        baselines for narrow spectral bandpasses.  The continuum of
        the other sideband is aliased into the observing band with a
        channel-dependent amplitude and opposite phase.  A new task
        FIXAL has been written to read a data set containing
        continuum, bandpass-quality calibrators to determine this
        pattern, which appears to be the same for all antenna pairs,
        polarizations, and IFs.  FIXAL then applies the correction to
        the primary data set, determining the phase of the continuum
        by fitting the pattern to those channels not containing
        spectral-line signals and then removing the aliased signal.
        A procedure FXALIAS has also been written.  This flags
        EVLA-EVLA baselines, runs BPASS, unflags EVLA-EVLA baselines,
        runs SPLAT, runs UVCOP to separate the bandpass calibrators
        toa second data set, and finally runs FIXAL.  This procedure
        will function for simple cases and offers a pattern for cases
        in which the user wishes less standard BPASS parameters or for
        the taking the alias pattern parameters from a different data
        set.  Both FXALIAS and FIXAL are marked in the helps as
        experimental for good reason.

        OPCODE= 'ANTP' or 'ANTC'. The variability can be added as

        DELZN has been created with the output file, using the
        number concept for the antennas. When this file is used
        for CLCOR (OPCODE=ATMO) with another UV data, the numbering
        of the antennas can be different, So I changed both DELZN and
        CLCOR using name instead of number for the antenna
        identification at this file.

12624.  June 07, 2008         IRING, ISPEC                   Eric
        Changed to give it more plot controls: choice of symbol type,
        size of symbol, error bar plotting, connecting of symbols,
        rescale and relable X axis (e.g. to go to pc rather than arc
        sec).  Added text output option (for PLOTR) and fixed plot
        type from 1 (misc) to a newly reserved 33.
        Changed: POPSDAT.HLP, NEWPARMS.001 to define new adverbs
        INTEXT, OUTTEXT, DATAIN, DATAOUT.  Wrote help files for them.
        Changed GINIT comment to allow plot type 33 for IRING and
        brought comment up to date.  Changed AU2A and AU8A to support
        PLGET for IRING type 33.
        Added displays of flux sums and number non-blanked plot points

        already open.  Changed it to open the TV or Tek once and for

12627.  June 12, 2008              EDITA                 Eric
        EDITA did not handle the UV-data FG table well when doing
        editing based on TY table values - BCHAN and ECHAN were 0 and
        this confused the interpretation of the values in the FG
        table.  Fixed QEDIUTIL to set BCHAN to 1 and ECHAN to UV-data
        max.  Also fixed code in TY and SN editing to avoid an initial
        plot using an antenna with no data.  This was avoided at later
        stages, but not at the start up.

        NEW TASK: simply tests the time ordering of a data set.  Tells
        you at what vis number data are not in increasing time order.
        It examines the entire data set and prints up to 100 of the
        failures.  Includes the calibration adverbs in case the time
        order error arises after application of those adverbs - a very
        rare case I would expect.

12638.  June 25, 2008              IMAGR                  Eric
        Changed UVWAIT to add a SUMWTIN keyword to the UV data header
        when doing the weighting.  Changed MAKMAP and IMGMEM to carry
        this from the UV file to the image file.
        Moved nowhere.

12639.  June 30, 2008            AIPSLetter               Eric
        $AIPSPUBL/LET08A.{PDF,PS,TEX} put bcak with the latest
        AIPSLetter content - also mailed today and put on web.
        Moved lots of places.

12640.  June 30, 2008           IMAGR et al.               Eric
        Changed SETDO3 to recognize UVDISK=0 to mean a scratch file -
        SCMAP has a scratch file rather than a fully cataloged file
        which confused it no end.
        Moved nowhere.

12641.  June 30, 2008             UVHGM                   Eric
        It does fit Gaussians - the inputs section on DOALL was
        telling an old, now incorrect thing.
        Moved nowhere.

12642.  July 1, 2008         FITTP, FITAB                 Eric
        Added FORMAT 4 to allow for 8-bit integer images which may be
        needed to feed some other picture-oriented software.
        Moved nowhere.

12643.  July 2, 2008              SETFC                   Eric
        Changed its decision making re maximum radius.  If the zenith
        angle is large, reduce allowed phase error by cos (za).  Also
        reduce allowed phase error if the average abs(w) > Wmax/4 or
        sqrt(average W^2) > Wmax/3.  Display reason and result.
        Changed default phase error to 45 degrees from 60.
        Moved nowhere.

12644.  July 4, 2008            APCLN, VTESS, etc         Eric
        The TV routines in APCLN, APGS, APVC, MX, SDCLN, STEER, UTESS,
        UVMAP, and VTESS did not make sure that the desired TV channel
        was on and the the others are off.  Wrote TVSET to off all
        channels, on 1 channel, zero and YCINIT that channel and fixed
        these tasks to call it.
        Moved nowhere.

12645.  July 4, 2008          CC files on UV data          Eric
        Apparently CC files can be found on UV data sets.
        Changed PRTCC to notice that it is UV data and to set the
        print scaling from the CC content rather than using the image
        header for guidance.
        Changed SETGDS and GRDAT to check for UV data and take
        defensive action.
        Changed VPLOT - the shift of 360 for phase plotting was not
        included in the model phase plot.
        Moved nowhere.

12646.  July 6, 2008              TVFLG                  Eric
        Changed TVFLG to set the number of channels in the work file
        and ECHAN and CHINC more carefully.  It got in trouble
        previously with not setting CHINC to a high number when 1
        channel is the result of the averaging.  It also had a
        round-off issue in doing I/O to the grid file if ECHAN was too
        large at that point.  Changed GRIDTB to set its own ECHAN and
        check that it agrees with the input.  Found error in restart
        with existing work file as well (ref pixel rather than
        invrement used one place).
        Moved nowhere.

12647.  July 6, 2008               IMAGR                   Eric
        Changed IMAGR.HLP and QCLEAN.FOR to have the option controlled
        by IMAGRP(8) amd (9) function slightly differently.  This
        option deletes weak isolated CCs (or perhaps all negative
        regions).  When the Clean would normally end due to FLUX or
        NITER et al., this option is run and the Clean is now
        restarted.  The next time it would normally end, the filtering
        is done but the Clean then finishes.  If one has filtered
        several times during exwecution, then this forced restart is
        not done.
        Moved nowhere.

12648.  July 7, 2008               RMSD                    Leonia
        Apparentely RMSD has not worked on small-memory computers
        because the size of required memory was too big. I diminished
        this size without any damage to the task.
        The history file is modified to include OPTYPE and FLUX.
        Moved nowhere.

12649.  July 8, 2009             FILLM               Eric/George M
        As far back as our records go (12/1990), FILLM has confused
        which IF goes with which in applying on-line flags for modes
        2BC, 2CD, 4, PA, and PB.  This means some data were flagged
        that should not have been and some were left unflagged that
        should have been flagged.  Note that the new OF table with
        PRTOF and OFLAG would have pointed out this error had we
        looked at appropriate data sets.
        Moved to 31DEC07 patch this date.

12650.  July 8, 2008              CONVL                   Eric
        The change of April 6 introduced an erroneous variable into
        the COMMON for the input parameters before the end of the list
        of input parameters.  Adverbs BPA, FACTOR, DOBLANK, and
        BADDISK were therefore lost.  Cleaned up help file also - the
        inputs section is not the help section.
        Moved nowhere.

12651.  July 9, 2008               SPLAT                   Eric
        If SPLAT is run with APARM(7)=0 but only 1 source to be
        written it goes to a great deal of trouble to insure that a
        multi-source output file is written with the source number
        unchanged.  This tripped up RNXUPD which makes an NX table on
        the fly and which uses source 1 when there is no source in the
        calibrated data.  Made a local copy of RNXUPD with a default
        source number argument for SPLAT alone.
        Moved nowhere.

12652.  July 9, 2008                UVFLG                 Eric
        Changed FLAGUP call sequence to return the actual number of FG
        records written or re-written.  Changed UVFLG, OFLAG, IBLED,
        TVFLG, and SPFLG for the changed call sequence and to report
        the number records written.  Changed FLAGUP to support REAS
        and WILD opcodes where WILD is REAS with wild cards/  Changed
        FLGSTK to accept WILD as an opcode.  Changed UVFLG help and
        Fortran to accept REAS and WILD and to make UFLG rather
        restrictive.  Unless you set adverbs to "I do not care"
        values, the FG table record and the adverb must match.  None
        of the dropping flags if there is some overlap.  Of course
        REAS and WILD only examine reason and all other adverbs are
        ignored.

12653.  July 11, 2008               CLCOR.HLP                 Leonia
	My recent change at DELZN/CLCOR (#12623, June 6) was not shown
        at help file. I do it now.

12654.  July 12, 2008               RMSD.FOR                  Leonia
        Following the request of Frazer Owen, another small add to
        the history file has been made.
        Moved nowhere.

12655.  July 14, 2008               CLCOR                     Leonia
        Recently I have modifyed DELZN/CLCOR changing antenna numbers
        to antenna names at the out(in)put file. This change can solve
        the dismatch of the antenna numbers at the DELZN's data and
        CLCOR's data if they are different. On the other hand it can
        create a problem when the file created earlier by DELZN
        (or by something yet) has antenna number concept, but CLCOR
        accept only antenna names concept. So I have modifyed CLCOR
        with "ATMO" to make CLCOR accept the both formats.
        Moved nowhere.

12656.  July 14, 2008               VPLOT                  Eric
        Added the phase plot fix to the place where phases are
        computed for models at computed U,V,W (NMAPS < 0).
        Movedd nowhere.

12657.  July 15, 2008              UVFLG                   Eric
        My changes made UFLG not the reverse of FLAG when BIF/EIF were
        defaulted.  Fixed this.
        Added WILD to inputs, clarified defaults of IF and chan.
        Moved nowhere.

12658.  July 15, 2008              FXALIAS                 Eric
        BPVER = 0 and apply flags (FLAGVER=0) in SPLAT.  Spell out all
        names and use = where it was being assumed.  Correct in2seq
        and in2disk in fixal setup.

12659.  July 15, 2008              DELZN                   Leonia
        Previously the fitted model was plotted vs of the recalculated
        SN table data. This was an only option. Now the direct SN table
        data can be plotted vs recalculated model.
        This option is added under control of APARM(10).
        The ploting itself is improved:
        Scaling and labeling of each plot is done for each individual
        plot. Previously it was identical for all plots.
        Moved nowhere.

12660.  July 15, 2008          EDITR, EDITA                 Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL:
        1. EDSLST - get the SOURCE adverb from the UV data set and if
        the first is not blank and the second blank (or = 1st), use
        that rather than the 8-character "OBJECT" name to search the
        SU table for the source number.  Also used for the SLIST(1)
        default.
        2. EDFCAP - use FLGANT(2) with AREA since it is not explicit
        about other baselines (FLAG ABOVE looks at all baselines to
        current antenna when one-antenna and marks each separately)
        like TIME, TIMERANG, and POINT.
        3. EDITxx - added code to detect pre-existing FC table and
        start with a REDO FLAGS command rather than show the data
        without the FC table applied.
        Moved nowhere.

12661.  July 16, 2008            CALIB                       Eric
        ACCOR, BPASS, CALIB, and CPASS all use the index table but had
        no defense against trying to read past the end of
        information.  Added defense against that error - which time
        inaccuracies can cause to occur - by testing on the known
        length and setting an appropriate scan end time when we have
        read all there is.
        Added messages to CALIB when there is a high failure rate
        to suggest WEIGHTIT=1, 'L1R', etc.
        Moved nowhere.

12662.  July 18, 2008               UVFLG                 Eric
        Changed UVFLG and FLAGUP to allow STOKES='----' to mean don't
        care and SOURCE='-' to mean don't care.  Changed help and
        added a hint about TAFLG if the UFLG is too demanding.  Added
        simple example to TAFLG's help too since it is a confusing
        task.
        Moved nowhere.

12663.  July 18, 2008            SDVEL                    Eric
        Put in a check of dates between the data header and the
        antenna file.  The antenna date is used for this shift and
        could be wrong if the AN file has been copied.  CATH(KHDOB)
        was used where a string variable should have been.
        Moved nowhere.

12664.  July 18, 2008             CALIB                   Eric
        CALIB had an algorithm that attempted to avoid short
        integrations within a scan by breaking up the scan into equal
        intervals.  With a tiny round out as well, this led to very
        unfortunate alignments between the fixed intervals and the
        regularly occurring data samples.  Changed the algorithm to
        use a local, scan-dependent SOLINT but to run the intervals
        from the data samples not from a regular grid of times.
        This should get us outputs that have equal integration time
        almost all the time.  This has become important due to the new
        presence of NX tables even on sihngle-source files.
        Moved nowhere.

12665.  July 18, 2008              FITLD                  Eric
        Code contained a computation of file size for expansion in
        AIPS bytes that overflowed on a 4 Gbyte file.  Fixed the
        computation to have a wider dynamic range - the actual integer
        is in kbyte units.
        Moved nowhere.

12666.  July 22, 2008            VLBAARCH                 Amy
        Fixed the archiving script so it would not croak if it encountered
        calibration tables (TY, GC & PC) with no rows.
        Moved nowhere.

12667.  July 24, 2008              VLANT                 Eric
        The change for macs to do curl first and then wget forgot that
        curl uses -o and wget uses -O for output.  Fixed I hope.
        Moved nowhere.

12668.  July 25, 2008            RMSD                    Eric
        Discovered a REAL variable being used as a DOUBLE, causing an
        important variable to be trashed on Intel Macs when
        optimized.  In the process, cleaned up the code some, repaired
        an error in BLAN optype and improved the process of binning
        data for the histogram fit.  It should now be faster.
        Moved nowhere.

12669.  July 28, 2008             CALIB                 Eric
        Fixed the time adjustment to be ).05 of the interval or 0.1sec
        whichever is smaller.  Otherwise intervals of 0.1sec became
        infinite loops.
        Moved nowhere.

12670.  July 28, 2008              FITLD                Eric
        The UV table reader set the time range for the table update
        routines.  If there was > 1 UV table in a file, the update
        would be done only on the time ramge of the second table.  The
        first would be ignored.
        GETMC and GETDEL had a gotcha - they tested if a local saved
        variable = the number of MC/IM records.  If not they set up
        that hash table.  But this does not cover the presence of a
        new MC/IM table with exactly the same number of records as the
        last.  Put the record as an argument so that the calling task
        can force a re-hash.  Changed FITLD, INDXH, INDXR, and
        TABLEUTIL for this.
        Moved nowhere.

12671.  July 28, 2008               LISTR               Eric
        Rick was wrong!  It seems clear that the VLA's *continuum*
        correlator efficiency is 0.89, not 0.805, as advertised in
        various documents.  (This is due to the oversampling by a
        factor of two that is effectively done -- the 'all products'
        formulation that Ken and Durga implemented back in 1998
        effectively improved our sensitivity by 10%).  So -- when
        LISTR computes the SEFD or effective Tsys, we need to use
        different conversion factors:
        SEFD = 228 * G2         was 206
        EFST = 40.5 * G2        was 36.8
        These are not the right factors for spectral line and they are
        a function of bandwidth.  This may be fixed later when they
        are known.

12672.  July 29, 2008               RMSD                Leonia
        Previously, RMSD returned zero for rms, if the histogram
        solution failed. Now the robust solution is used at such
        case, if it is available. If not then robust solution is
        determined and then used.

12673.  July 29, 2008           APCAL                   Amy
        Removed spurious message for people using weather file rather
        than WX table.

12674.  July 29, 2008              LISTR                 Eric
        Rick was wrong again - the coefficients are returned to their
        original values.
        Moved nowhere.

12675.  July 29, 2008           aliasing                 Eric
        Changed:
        BPASS    to offer the option of amplitude only BP function
        FIXAL    to reduce the adverbs users should not use and add
                 options to not average across baseline, IF,
                 polarization, and time, to allow a full complex
                 aliasing function, and to allow Hanning smoothing of
                 the aliasing function.
        FXALIAS  to set BPASSP(4) to -1 (amplitude only), BPASSP(9) to
                 1 (interpolate flagged), and to set bchan=echan=0 in
                 SPLAT.
        Added DPARM to FXALIAS help file and made appropriate changes
        to BPASS and FIXAL help files.
        Moved nowhere.

12676.  July 30, 2008              imaging                  Eric
        GRDSUB did not handle the old case - needed when FFT of image
        - and did not call GRDAT so parameters were not known.  Added
        another ELSE for image so that size parameters are set.
        Relink a lot.
        Moved nowhere.

12677.  August 4, 2008           SHIFT                 Eric
        I took a look at the usage of SHIFT and it is a mess.
        1. Changed help files for FACES, SETFC, HORUS, IM2UV to make
           it clear that SHIFT is in asec at the reference position.
           The help files simply did not say.
        2. FRPLT applied the phase correction with a strange sign
           (as if coordinates had been shifted but they had not) and
           did the shift as a pure Delta RA.
        3. UVLIN, UVLSF, UVLSD shifted with delta RA, DEC coordinates
           rather than arcsec at the source.  Fixed help and Fortran.
        4. UVLSD, UVLSF, UVLIN ignored IF in computing the frequency
           to shift phases.  Added CHNDAT call and use results.
        5. FRPLT also ignored the IF in doing the shift.  It invoked
           FOFF and FINC elsewhere but never set them or used the
           result.  Added CHNDAT call which enables the frequency to
           be used in shift and fixed the shift code.
        6. DFTPL help file implied SHIFT was in coordinates, but the
           code multipled SHIFT(1) times U and SHIFT(2) times V
           directly!  It did have correct frequency handling however.
           Fixed the coordinate handling.
        Moved nowhere.

12678.  August 4, 2008         UVLIN, UVBAS              Eric
        Besides the SHIFT corrections, added cal adverbs and changed
        input data reading accordingly.
        Moved nowhere.

12679.  August 4, 2008            TBAVG                  Eric
        Changed:
        Help     Add SHIFT adverb, make clear the absence of flagging,

        Fortran  Drop excess junk and clean up TBAVER.  First sample
                 in each integration was not counted in average time.
                 Added code to get the FOFFs and to shift the phases
                 before summing.  Changed averaging to weighted.
                 Dropped copying of numerous tables which are no
                 longer meaningful or, in the case of NX, correct.

12682.  August 4, 2008        UVMOD, PHSRF                Eric
        Added calibration and flagging.  PHSRF never worked properly
        for multiple polarizations or IFs - there was an addressing
        problem with the answer from AVGCHN.  That has been corrected
        as has the weight computation.

        Corrected usage of deleted parameter and mis-spelled parameter

12690.  August 13, 2008           GPOS, FPOS              Eric
        System adverbs need to have standard usages - both FPPOS and
        GPOS are used as absolute pixels, relative pixels, and arc

12696.  September 2, 2008             UVCOP                 Eric
        The copying of IM tables depends on IMSEL which depends on
        the Flatters' routines IMINIT and TABIM.   The latter had an
        incorrect subscript so that the PDELAY for the 2nd
        polarization was read from the GDELAY 2nd polarization column.
        IMSEL is called with all copying tasks so this will be a
        common problem.  I can find no place in AIPS that uses the
        PDELAY parameter however.

12697.  September 3, 2008            FACSET                Eric
        FACSET sums the CC flux over all facets except for standard
        calibrators.  In that case, it was summing only the flux
        within the central radius of the source but it allowed that
        radius to be placed at the center of each facet.  Fixed code
        so that it looks only at facet 1 in the standard calibrator
        case and says as much at the end (when there is > 1 facet).

        CALIB rounds times outwar when looking at scans from the index

        FACSET confused the subscript order in the alternative names
        and so used the wrong radius for names for the cal sources.

12702.  September 5, 2005         modeling                 Eric
        CCSMEM did not handle the case in which a CC file has no valid
        components (either empty or all flagged) correctly.  It
        regarded this as an error and bailed out causing TABED
        modified CC files to fail to model correctly in CALIB et al.
        This only becomes a problem when we were trying to do many
        fields at once which is a relatively new capability.

12704.  September 8, 2008           CALIB               Eric
        Suggestions from Olaf Wucknitz (Uni-Bonn):
        CLBPA: Error branch kept solution from propogating to 2nd
               polarization when polarizations averaged.
        CALIB: Count of bad solutions used pol 2 for counting twice,
               ignoring pol 1, a typo
        CALIB: The output routine to the SN table messed with the
               weight of the reference antenna, forcing it to be at
               least SNRMIN+1.  This messes up counting of bad
               solutions and passing failed solutions as 1,0.  Dropped
               the special treatment of the ref antenna and the change
               in weights.

        The recent modification of UVPLT includes condition .EQ.42
        to carry out the plot of U vs V (or V vs U) under control of
        APARM. The product 6x7 is equal 42. But the product
        14x3 is equal 42 also. This fact may corrupt the plot of
        hour angle(14) vs UV dist(3). So I have changed the condition.

        VLBATECR - added 'zcat' to the possible uncompress commands to

12712.  September 23, 2008            IMAGR                 Eric
        Develop the ability to grid multiple facets at one time and
        then take advantage of that in IMAGR.  Changed
        UTILITY    Added OBFSIZ to return the size of the disk file
                   attached to an object.  Used to decide if the UV
                   work file is large or if the OS will hold it in
                   memory.
        BEMFIT     New: fits elliptical Gaussian to beam image known
                   in imaging commons.  Called by IMGMEM, needed to
                   make call before extended resolution "beam" writes
                   over the normal tapered beam.
        QNGRD      New: A version of Q1GRD but it must move data from
                   protected area to work area, do the 3x3 matrix
                   multiply on u,v,w to rotate to the new facet phase
                   center, check/fix for rotated U negative, and
                   check/blank when rotated u,v outside image as well
                   as the taper, freq adjust etc done in Q1GRD.
        Q1FIN      Cleaned up typing while correcting error.  It
                   tested for the symmetric row being below the
                   address of the X convolving function rather than
                   below the start of the grid.  Fortunately, this
                   test never has anything to do.
        IMGMEM     New call sequence to give a list of fields to
                   image this time including their tapers.  Now loops
                   over field to prepare gridding parameters, then
                   calls GRDMEM to grid all request fields, then
                   loops over fields to do FFT and grid correct and
                   beam fit if appropriate.
        GRDMEM     New call sequence to pass in a list of fields and
                   tapers and send bak lists of GRID addresses, max Y
                   row used, and sum of weights.  Now loops over
                   fields to init parameters and set grid addresses.
                   Then loops through data filling data buffers into
                   the AP and, when needed, looping over fields to
                   grid the data now in AP to the fields.  Finally,
                   loops over fields with zero spacing and finishing
                   operations.
        GRCMEM     New call sequence to pass in the scaling parameter
                   rather than depend on common variable BEMMAX(field).
        GRDFIT     New gridding routine reuires 2 copies of data and
                   it was noted that data come in blocks of the buffer
                   size rather than simply the logical record size
                   when moved to the AP by GRDMEM.
        QUVUTIL    OUVIMG: change call sequence meaning to allow
                   IFIELD to be optionally a forced list of fields
                   in addittion to a single number or 0 => all.  Sum
                   total memory needed as well as max for 1 image.
                   Decide FAST (=> IMGMEM) based on largest single
                   image but ask for AP memory enough to do
                   everything.  Call GRDFIT and sort only if not
                   FAST.  Break the DOBEAM and not DOBEAM segments
                   into not FAST (MAKMAP essentially unchanged) and
                   FAST segments.  In the latter, make a list of the
                   fields that will fit at the moment and call IMGMEM
                   with that list.  Manually loop for the next list if
                   any.  In the image FAST section, break it into 2
                   parts one of which does consecutive field numbers
                   and the other of which supports the forced list.
        QCLEAN     CLNUV2: Put in code at start to decide how many
                   facets (MXLIST) to image each time we look for the
                   next strongest.  Large work file => want more, big
                   images prevent more.  Use list returned by CLBSTF -
                   if the top of the list has not been imaged lately,
                   image as much of the list as is not current and
                   then call CLBSTF to make a new list of apparently
                   most desirable facets.  If the top of the list is
                   current, then clean that facet.
                   CLBSTF: changed to make an ordered list of
                   apparently desirable fields rather than returning
                   only one with a clue about the second.
                   CLORDR: new to insert a field in the ordered list
                   when appropriate.

        after re-imaging and if the apparent top score for the

        than image more.  This option has been present under control

        Corrected:
        GRDMEM   It used LROW as a synonym for NY so LROW must be
                 of the dimension MXIMAG and subscripted.  Messed up
                 when not all images are the same size.
        QCLEAN   Did not offer the TV option to look at any field when
                 there are > 64.
        QCLEAN   Remade all images when one tried to force a field.
        TVUTIL   Used the image header in COMMON which is not

12719.  September 25-30, 2008    header keywords             Eric
        Most tasks fail to copy the header keywords to the output file
        sometimes for partial good reason.  Wrote new routine KEYPCP
        to copy all keywords except for specified list with a default
        list of ISCALE, IZERO, ACTNOISE, and ACTMEAN.
        Added KEYCOP to tasks

12720.  October 1, 2008             UVMOD                  Eric
        For some reason the HI write and table copy came before the UV
        subroutine.  The actual number of vis written did not then
        make it to the header.  The calibration read routines survived
        this, but not more normal routines.

12721.  October 1, 2008             TYAPL                  Eric
        Added a default for INVERS = IN2VERS = 0.

12722.  October 2, 2008            UVCOP                  Eric

        table used on the UV data.
        Moved nowhere.

12723.  October 3, 2008         preparation              Eric
        Changed QUVUTIL, FACSET, VSCDFT, CCSMEM, VSFDFT, GRDSUB,
        VISDFT, and GRDCRM to use ABS(CCVER(i)) rather than CCVER
        directly.  This is in preparation for the sign of CCVER to
        convey the fact that it is a temporary CC file.

12724.  October 3, 2008          3C48 X-band             Eric/Amy
        There have been reports of trouble with the 3C48 X-band model
        previously released.  It was based primarily on an 8-hour
        Craig Walker run from ~1991.  It has been replaced with a
        model based primarily on other data sets which works better
        for most data although not Walker's.  This mystery is not
        understood.

12725.  October 7, 2008           CCRES                 Eric
        Added FACTOR adverb to control scaling the residual image.
        Added default scaling of the residual image to correct for
        "beam area".  Added OPCODES 'ADDP' and 'S+AP' to put the
        components back as 1-pixel points.  Added code to test the
        actual scaling to Jy/beam - the beam area for largish beams is
        about what theory would say (1.1331 * bmaj * bmin in pixels)
        but for small beam, the fact that one samples only at a few
        points makes the actual integral of the Gaussian something
        else.  This made of order 18% difference with a bmaj and bmin
        intended to make 1.1331*bmaj*bmin be 1.0.  With the '...P'
        change output units to JY/PIXEL'.

12726.  October 8, 2008            UVCOP                 Eric
        Extended the UVCOPPRM(6) option to flag tables tp a bit
        pattern with the 1 bit for TY and the 2 bit for SN and added
        SNFSEL and SNFLG subroutines to UVCOP.

12728.  October 9, 2008      modeling with images          Eric
        Modeling with images works fine if the images are suitable
        except that subimages failed.  Created two new routines:
        IMGSIZ   figures out a power of 2 image size that will allow
                 the reference pixel to be at the usual center
        SUBGET   a simplified version of PLNGET that does the placing
                 of a subimage within the larger area of zeros.
        Changed routines:
        FFTIM    to call SUBGET rather than PLNGET
        SETGDS   to call IMGSIZ to set FLDSZ
        GRDAT    to call IMGSIZ to set FLDSZ
        GRDSET   to call IMGSIZ to set the size of scratch files

12730.  October 13, 2008
        Create new adverbs CALIN, INLIST, DATA2IN in POPSDAT and

12731.  October 14, 2008            SPFLG                 Eric
        Corrected bug setting the pix-ranges for display modes > 4 -
        including the 3 difference modes.  Raised the buffer size
        which should speed up the initial I/O and also allow larger
        scan lengths.  When scan length is lowered due to memory
        limitations, add message.  Fixed TSKHLP to first try for exact
        match in the names of the functions and then do the min
        match.  DISPLAYY PHASE was coming out when DISPLAY PHASE DIFF
        was desired.

12733.  October 15, 2008    Nasmyth telescope mounts       Eric
        Richard Dodson has supplied code modifications to allow AIPS
        to support a variety of new mount types:
        0 alt-az, 1 equitorial, 2 orbiting, 3 X-Y, 4 right-handed
        Nasmyth, 5 left-handed Nasmyth (0,1,2 are old codes)
        6 prime focus/folded cassegrain
        Changed
        CLCOR    ANAXIS allows mount >= 3 to do as mount=0
        DFCOR    as CLCOR
        DTSIM    Exclusion of orbiting antenna mount types needs to
                 NE.2 now rather than LT.2.  Extra computation for
                 Nasmyth and X-Y mounts in s.r. ORIENT.
        PRTAN    Add to list of mount types
        SNPLT    Add code for position angle by more mount types
                 in s.r. ANTGEO
        APCAL    Orbiting antenna selectioon is .EQ.2 not .GT.1
        TABAN    add to pre-cursor comments
        PARANG   Major changes: add code to call SOUELV for Nasmyth

        Corrected log amplitude plot in UVPLT to be LOG10 not natural
        log.  Added CODETYPE = 'LA&P' and 'LAMP' to POSSM to plot
        BPARM(5) * LOG10 (amplitude).  Corrected bug that caused the
        imaginary plot in R&I to have no plus signs.

12735.  October 17, 2008          GAL                    Eric
        Added to the OUTTEXT output when CPARM(6) not zero and OUTTEXT
        not blank.  It will list both ends of the major axis and the
        rotation curve: radius (arcsec), velocity, and rms of velocity

12737.  October 20, 2008           FILLM                   Eric
        The change of September 12 (#12709) had unintended
        consequences.  The band changed to the new band before the
        present scan was finished.  The only known consequence was to
        the last record in the CL and TY tables.  The latter would
        matter only for 4 or P band and would cause a different system
        temperature to be chosen.  The CL table however would have the
        atmospheric opacity and antenna gain correction for the next
        band rather than the present band.  This could make a
        substantial (e.g. 5 %) difference in the gains.  Use of INDXR
        to make a new CL table erases this problem.
        Changed the code to find the new band only for deciding about
        keeping the data or not but leaving the band ID unchanged
        until the data are fully absorbed.

        Updated INFILE, IN2FILE, OUTFILE, OUTPRINT, INTEXT, OUTTEXT,
        DATAIN, and DATAOUT help files with full lists of who uses
        them.

12747.  November 17, 2008           IMAGR                   Eric
        Changed Fortran in IMAGR.FOR to allow DO3D if necessary to do
        ATNF with multi-scale or large numbers of facets with a
        warning.
        Moved nowhere.

12748.  November 18, 2008          FILLM                 Eric
        The subroutine that is used when CPARM(4) is not 0 or 25.0 had
        an error in computing sqrt (u^2 + v^2) due to a misplaced
        close parenthesis.  abs(u) + v^2 was examined instead.
        This matters since apparently the on-line system has been
        setting the shadow-flag bit wrongly and that bit is used when
        CPARM(4)= 0 or 25.0.  Clarified this in the help file.
        Moved to 31DEC07 this date..

12749.  November 20, 2008           INDXR                 Eric
        Changed limit in INFILE option from 50 to 5000 breaks.
        Moved nowhere.

12750.  November 24, 2008           LOCIT                 Eric
        Raised max points from 400 to 50000 for unreasonable people.
        Added test and die for overflow.  Added a flag for when no OT
        table is present to read SN table anyway.
        Moved nowhere.

12751.  November 26, 2008           DOUVCOMP             Eric
        Changed POPSDAT.HLP and AU2A (verb DEFAULT) to have the
        default value for DOUVC be -1 (false).
        Moved nowhere.

12752.  December 7, 2008           TABSRT                 Eric
        The sort of BP tables in particular is inefficient since there
        are a lot of data values in each record.  Added to TABSRT a
        call to a new subroutine BTBSRT which does a "brute force"
        sort.  It makes a list of the 2 key values and record number,
        sorts that, and then does a gather read to the output file.

12754.  December 7, 2008         misc                    Eric
        Fixed $SYSLINUX/LDOPTS.SH to set STRIP=FALSE (now not a known
        option).
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12755.  December 8, 2008           ACCOR                 Eric
        Added code to trap the no data found case and set errors.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12756.  December 8, 2008           DFTPL                  Eric
        Due to a typo, DFTPL plotted data only from spectral channel 1
        including averaging channel 1 from BCHAN to ECHAN times.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12757.  December 10, 2008     VLBAUTIL/VLBAPCOR            Amy
        If INVERS was set in VLBAPCOR it was used when CLCAL was
        run as part the procedure.  This was a bug and INVERS is
        now set to 0 for CLCAL.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12758.  December 10, 2008          3C147_X              Amy/Eric
        Installed the last standard image: 3C147 at X band reduced and
        imaged all by Amy.
        Moved nowhere (all versions get it automatically).

12759.  December 10, 2008           PCCOR               Amy/Eric
        Changed OPTIMIZE.LIS to have PCCOR not optimized.  The Intel
        compiler gets 1 antenna wrong when optimized.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12762.  December 11, 2008      ACCOR, CLCAL                  Eric
        Changed ACCOR to delete the new SN table when there is an
        error, such as no data found.
        Changed SNAPP to return error -1 on empty SN table or empty
        output SN table.
        Changed CLCAL to trap this error return and to quit promptly
        when no SN data were found.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12765.  December 12, 2008         UVFIX, HAFIX            Leonia
        Investigation of the polar motion from 1979 till 2008 shows:
        1. ROMAX/ROMIN<30.8; RO=SQRT (POLRX^2 + POLRY^2);
        2. RO < 0.6 arcsec;
        30.8 is coefficient of recalculation meters to arcsec.
        This fact allows to determine the units of POLRXY based on
        the value of POLRXY.
        The following codes are added to UVFIX and HAFIX

        IF (RO .GT. 0.6) THEN
           UNITS of POLRXY are meters;
           recalculate POLRXY to arcsec
        ELSE
	   UNITS are arcses
           END IF

12767.  December 12, 2008           FILLM                 Eric
        Changed:
        1. For revisions >29 (post ModComp) the shadowing will be
           handled by FILLM rather than by using the erroneous on-line
           flag bit.
        2. The array configuration will now be computed as best as
           possible by FILLM.  The on-line data set depends on
           operator intervention and so is sometimes incorrect.
           This only appears in the FILLM history cards.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12768.  December 12, 2008           TVCPS                Eric
        Something got changed in the software that prints PostScript
        at the AOC - it claims to care more about following some sort
        of standards.  Added some junk and took out the %%BeginProlog
        comment and now it seems to work.
        Magical thinking moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12769.  December 14, 2008               UVDEC                 Eric

        The new BTBSRT can call ICSORT with a serious number of
        records.  Changed the untested internal limit of 1024 to a
        tested limit of 20480 in ICSORT.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12772.  December 18, 2008           TVCPS                    Eric
        More commands were found to be out of order in a formal
        PostScript sense.  The EndComments and EndProlog must come
        after the BeginSetup .. EndSetup that specifies fonts used.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12773.  December 19, 2008          CALIB                  Eric
        Data were included in the average if the time <= the begin
        time + solint - they should not be on = so changed that to
        time <= begin time + solint - 0.001s.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12775.  December 24, 2008            UVDIF                Eric
        The CLIP only subroutine had an erroneous subscript KK rather
        than K which caused it not to find bad amplitudes although it
        reported them in the max difference over max flux value.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12776.  December 24, 2008        imaging problem          Eric
        The change that allowed subimages to be padded out and used
        for modeling has caused nasty problems with non-3D imaging
        (i.e. de Sade's principle).  Changed:
        GRDAT      to drop IMGSIZ call and set FLDSZ to max of its
                   current value and the image's size.
        SETGDS     to defer the setting of FLDSZ until the full set of
                   images are examinined and the MODEL value
                   determined.  Saves the IMGSIZ outputs and the image
                   size values in a temp array for this.
        Must move to 31DEC08 but this should delay a final freeze!

12777.  December 26, 2008           VBGLU                 Eric
        The task had 3 main problems:
        1. When disk I/O had to be restarted because the required UV
        record preceded the ones in RAM, the task checked a few of the
        upcoming records to find the minimum needed input record
        number.  Thus the first record number in the new buffer could
        be one that preceded the currently required one.
        Unfortunately, the pointer was set to the first in the new
        buffer always.  This led to wrong baseline data being included
        in the output record.  Raised the search region and made sure
        it did not search over empty records and made the pointer aim
        at the desired record.
        2. On AT tables, the task asks for a SOURCE column that is not
        present in the table and so quit on AT tables.  Added a
        spexcial error test for this, allowing it to procede normally
        since the copy can handle a missing selection column.
        3. The handling of character-data columns was incorrect.  So
        far as I can tell, the error only damaged CQ tables.
        Corrected all the length handling for character-valued columns
        of 1 or more dimensions (includes AT, CT, and SU tables).
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12778.  December 26, 2008         ACFIT                 Eric
        Was setting CLVER not CLUSE from adverb GAINUSE and so always
        applied the highest CL table.
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12779.  December 29, 2008         AIPSLetter                Eric
        Put back the TeX, ps, and pdf forms of the 31Dec AIPSLetter.
        Moved to all versions automatically.

        The business of dividing a scan up somehow into intervals when
        the actual integration time and the user's SOLINT may be an
        exact match or not is simply a mess.  The existing code where
        I add a -DEPS could cause an infinite loop if the scan
        integration time is zero which is legal although not usually
        correct.  It could also cause it to do an extra solution on
        the last sample of a scan.  Changed it to fix the integration
        end to be > scan end when it was computed to be exactly the
        scan end to avoid both problems.  Deleted a bunch of old code
        that has been commented out for a while.

        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12784.  January 5, 2009    UVW scaling, IMAGR               Eric
        The calibration routines do not correct UVW for a change in
        the header frequency even though they do issue a new header
        frequency.  Checked over all the code for errors and was
        relieved to discover that UVCOP, SPLIT, and SPLAT among others
        did this right.  IMAGR attempted to do it right too but a
        recent (2008) change to GRDMEM made some error:
        BASAVG    $APLNOT subroutine that appears not to be used -
                  changed it to scale output UVW
        GRDMEM    $QNOT: the UVW scaling for the first channel was
                  used before it was computed - so first call to
                  GRDMEM would make an error but later calls would
                  have it okay.  Affects IMAGR, SCMAP, SCIMG.
        DECOR     Already did scaling
        UVLIN     The TRUEF used for phase shifting should have used
                  UVFREQ since it is based on the input FOFFs rather
                  than FREQ which is the BIF/FQID selected new
                  frequency.  Add UVW scaling but after function call
                  since that deals with input UVW correctly.
        UVLSF     As UVLIN
        UVLSD     As UVLIN

        This business at the end of scans is still getting us.
        Changed the latest changed code so that if the current
        interval is within 60% of SOLINT of the end of the scan, the
        end time of the interval is made significantly larger than the
        end of the scan.  (Note that making it 3 milliseconds larger
        than a scan in day 3 was for some reason not enough.)
        Moved to 31DEC08 this date.

12788.  January 8, 2009           CALIB                  Eric
        Yet again!  The NX table contains center times and intervals
        which are in single precision floating point.  It is thus able
        to indicate an end time that is actually less than the real
        end time by more than a few milliseconds.  Added an error
        margin of 0.2 seconds which will still be inadequate if the
        times get into several days or more.
        The handling of NX records with subarray and freqid that do
        not match the current ones was incorrect.  An NX table can
        contain overlapping scans with different subarrays and/or
        freqids.  Changed the NX reading code to accept only matching
        scans and dropped the tests on data matching NX record
        subarrays/freqids since that would cause pre-mature reading of
        a new NX record in the case of overlaps.  The data from UVGET
        will always be only the desired subarray and freqid and
        therefore does not need examination.
        Added a long section to the help for SOLINT.

12790.  January 9, 2009            CALIB                   Eric
        The subarray got lost so the SN table did not have a subarray
        value and so the next subarray deleted the previous one.

12796.  January 27, 2009            CALIB                Eric
        The fix for solution interval getting set to zero was not made
        for the first record in the NX table only for all later ones -
        so of course that bit us.

12824.  April 1, 2009             OFMs                   Eric
        The files in $AIPSOFM havingvarious OFM coloring schemes
        needed to be updated for the new depth of a plane (0-2045)
        from the old depth (0-255).  Did this with AIPS itself on some
        and with a stand alone program for others.  Fixed those with
        abrupt changes by hand also.  Put them back as *.000 to allow
        31DEC07 to read the old ones.  Changed OFMDIR and OFMGET to
        handle the new names and possible format revisions for the
        larger intensity numbers which can go to 16*2046-1.
        Moved to patch this date.

12832.  April 21-22, 2009              IMAGR                  Eric
        Found error in QCLEAN with FORCE A FIELD option that caused
        all images to be remade rather than just the requested one.
        Found error that caused scratch disk files to be way too large
        for gridded subtraction with DO3D false.  Added FFTIM to
        GRDSET to set size directly from image for FFTIM false and to
        use IMSIZ which uses the reference pixel too for images.
        Changed GRDSUB for this call seq change.
        Moved to patch April 22.

12835.  April 27, 2009             DBCON                  Eric
        Changed KEYCOP call to KEYPCP to block MAXBLINE and MAXABSU

12846.  May 15, 2009              IMAGR                  Eric
        The restoration of CCs from one image to other overlapped ones
        uses the pseudo AP memory directly.  A test for whether it fit
        check against the size in kilowords ratther than words - a
        mere 87000 overlapped components would cause it to do bad
        things when in fact it should have been 87 million CCs.
        Fixed QCLEAN

        QUVUTIL  Raise the needed memory returned by GRDFIT by 10
                 kwords - previously it truncated that needed value so
                 that the QINIT call did not get enough and a sort was
                 almost always "needed".
        QCLEAN   Raise the return requested size from GRDFIT by 10 %
                 and try a second time to avoid a sort.

12905.  July 26, 2009          install.pl                 Eric
        Changed SCREEN_1 - when it did not find a tarball it did not
        hop to SCREEN_1_RETRY which it should have done.  Rearranged a
        few } to have it do that.

12923.  August 18, 2009           FITLD                   Eric
        When rearranging the frequencies in reading IDI-format data,
        FITLD did not correct the ANtenna file frequency.  This is
        used by UVFIX and so is important.

12997.  November 11, 2009         BPASS, CPASS            Eric
        BPASS, CPASS, and PHSRF all picekd up the ICHANSEL adverb
        badly, leading to IFs > 1 averaging all channels!  The other

13021.  November 30, 2009          ANFIX8               Eric
        Created a RUN file ANCHECK to check antenna By positions in
        the antenna file.  The recent bug found in FITLD means that a
        few antennas in the archive will have erroneous By values.
        This proc is to check on them.  A different proc ANFIX8 is put
        in 31DEC08 to allow VLBA archive people to change back to the
