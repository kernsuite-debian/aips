\section{Recent Developments}
The \AIPS\ group has begun a major re-write of the software package,
in order to incorporate software
capabilities needed for the coming decade.
A major consequence of this plan is that \AIPS\ has been frozen.  Current
software development in \AIPS\  is limited to improvements needed in the short
term for VLBA calibration and certain experimental imaging tasks.  Of course,
bugs will be fixed as soon as possible.  However, if bugs can be ``worked
around'' using existing \AIPS\  software, these bug fixes will have very low
priority.  Because most software development effort must go toward the new
\AIPS\, no extensive software modifications to old \AIPS\ can be supported.

The 15JUL91 release of \AIPS\ has been {\bf canceled}.
The next planed release of \AIPS\ will be 15APR92.
However, a 15OCT91 release may be made public if sufficient changes
are made to the VLBI data reduction software to warrant an early release.
