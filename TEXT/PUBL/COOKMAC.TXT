             Using the Cookbook Macro Package

1. Chapters, subchapters, ...
      \sect{xxx}      starts a new page with a new chapter called xxx
      \tsect{xxx}     as \sect but no page eject
      \subsect{yyy}   starts subsection entitled yyy which will appear
                         on the page heading
      \subsubsect{zz} makes a lower level section (no page heading)


2. A task sample inputs section: (see p 6 bottom of Cookbook for example)

      Form:  <start-of-paragraph-text:>
             \disp..{tt-text \CR}{explanation-text}
             \pd

      or:    <start-of-paragraph-text:>
             \disp..{tt-text \CR}{explanation-text}
             \dispe{continue-the-paragraph-text}

      (where \pd is the same as \parskip\parsdef)

      useful macro: \qs   forces a full-size space in text

      basic disp.. macros:
        \dispt     1 expl. line,    prompt >,   normal expl size
        \disptt    > 1 expl. line,  prompt >,   normal expl size
        \dispf     1 expl. line,    prompt >,   normal expl size on next
                                                line (commands are long)
        \displ     1 expl. line,    prompt >,   small (horiz.) expl size
        \displl    > 1 expl. line,  prompt >,   small (horiz.) expl size
        \dispx     1 expl. line,    no prompt,  normal expl size
        \dispxx    > 1 expl. line,  no prompt,  normal expl size
        \displx    1 expl. line,    no prompt,  small (horiz.) expl size
        \displxx   > 1 expl. line,  no prompt,  small (horiz.) expl size


3. Indented, numbered display section    (see page 4 for example)

        \hanstart{50pt}
        \enumerate{1}{text-entry-1}
        \enumrnext{text-entry-2}
        \hangnxtpar{text-not-numbered-(optional)}
        \par\hanend


4. Odds and ends:
        \uth           as in $4^{\uth}$
        \und           as in $2^{\und}$
        \ust           as in $1^{\ust}$
        \urd           as in $3^{\urd}$
        \qquad         2 quads horizontal space
        \rquad         4 quads horizontal space
        \dol           a \tt dollar sign
        \Sec           a section symbol
        \Secs          2 section symbols (for e.g. "Sections 3 and 4")
        \eg            puts in {\it e.g.,}
        \Eg            puts in {\it E.g.,}
        \ie            puts in {\it i.e.,}
        \Ie            puts in {\it I.e.,}
        \uv            puts in {\it uv}
        \Uv            puts in {\it Uv}
        \botpage       puts in a \vskip ...\eject
        \AIPS
        \Aipsletter
        \Cookbook
        \boxit{t}{s}{text}   boxes {text} with lines of width {t}
                             and space {s} : \boxit{1pt}{5pt}{damn!}


5. Fonts:
       \tt     program names
       \us     things the user types in verbatim
       \it     things user substitutes something for
