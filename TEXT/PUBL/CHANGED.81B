  418.  Oct. 6, 1981     LSCAL , ASCAL                   FredwA        I invented a new task, for use on the Vax's only, whichL?        is identical to ASCAL except that larger data arrays n@        are provided.  This allows one to avoid averaging when>"        a long solution interval is used.  21411 visibility >,        points can be held in the arrays.  This is 10m10s of 6        10 second Filler data.?@            Also, in the least-squares gain solution routine,.>J        I increased the iteration limit ITMAX from 30 to 40.?T        Usually when one hits this limit, the data are bad ors=^        the model is bad.  In very low S/N cases, or with a Ah        translated model, the limit of 30 sometimes was legiti-s?r        mately encountered.  This change was made only in thes"|        TEST area on the CV Vax.=Ü            Additional change, again only on CV Vax: GCALC,Z=ê        with the print option turned on, now prints the rms;ö        residual (Jy) at each iteration.  GCALC1 prints aaA§        quantity which is essentially (i.e., for small epsilon)./Æ        equal to the mean absolute residual. eA∏            Also, a minor change to GCALC1: I changed the threeiA¬        values of epsilon from 50, 5, and .5 mJy to 5, .5, and t@Ã        .05 -- these are the values which I thought I had been÷        using.‡@Í  419.
