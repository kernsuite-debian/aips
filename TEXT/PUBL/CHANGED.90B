 5421.  November 7, 1989                 SPLIT              Phil
        SPLIT was screwing up the writing of compressed data.
        A variable KLOCWT was used to describe the random parameter
        offset in the output data, this was set to # r.p's + 1.
        However this same variable was also used to define the offset
        in the input data, so the input data was screwed. Redefined
        KLOCWT to LLOCWT.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5422.  November 7, 1989                 VLBIN              Phil
        The lobe rotation correction on station 'B' autocorrelation
        spectra was being done incorrectly. The ra/dec passed to
        the geometry calculation routine were passed as degrees
        rather than radians, also the natural fringe rate calculated
        was then applied with the wrong sign.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5423.  November 9, 1989              Print files              Eric
        Added adverb OUTPRINT to all printing tasks and verbs to allow
        the user to specify a file name outside the regular AIPS
        file-naming conventions in which to save the printed output.
        This file must be a new file and is likely to be deleted if
        the task terminates prematurely.  The low-level Z routines
        have allowed this since the overhaul.  It was a matter of
        adding the adverb and passing it down to them.  Changed help
        files and fortran code for tasks BLSUM, CORER, IMFIT, JMFIT,
        LISTR, PRTAB, PRTAC, PRTAN, PRTCC, PRTGA, PRTIM, PRTSD,
        PRTTP, PRTUV, TXPL, UVDIF, and UVFND.  Changed help files
        for verbs EXPLAIN, HELP, PRTHI, and PRTMSG.  Other specific
        changes were:
        DAPL.INC     Added adverb OUTPRT as a HOLLERITH of dimension 12.
        POPSDAT.HLP  Added adverb OUTPRINT as STRING*48.
        OUTPRINT.HLP New help file for new adverb.
        NEWPARMS.001 Added adverb OUTPRINT as STRING*48.
        ZOPEN        (APLGEN:) Changed to pass PHNAME through to LPOPEN
                     rather than sending blanks.
        AU1          Changed call to PRTMSG to get OUTPRT in character
                     form for verb PRTMSG.
        AU1A         Convert OUTPRT to character for ZOPEN call for HELP
                     and EXPLAIN.
        AU7          Convert OUTPRT to character for ZOPEN call for PRTHI.
        PRTMSG       Added OUTPRINT as character to call sequence and
                     changed ZOPEN call to pass it on.
        BATER        Added OUTPRINT to symbol list and to call to PRTMSG.
        GRIPR        Added OUTPRINT to symbol list and to call to PRTMSG;
                     corrected addressing to character string adverbs.
        PRTAC        Added output file name option to stand-alone mode
                     of this task as well, so long as the print file has
                     not yet been opened.  Moved that opening to the last
                     possible moment.
        TXPL         Corrected typing of code some, clarified usage of
                     DOCRT so that it can give width of wider terminals,
                     corrected it to resume AIPS when it writes to the
                     history or message files.
        The user may just RUN NEWPARMS to get this adverb for his
        tasks, but to have it recognized for the verbs he/she must
        do RESTORE 0.
        Moved nowhere.

 5424.  November 9, 1989             APCLN                 Chris
        APCLN now creates scratch files large enough to hold the
        larger of an $ny$ by $nx+1$ image or a $2ny$ by $nx/2 + 1$
        image, where $nx$ and $ny$ are the numbers of pixels on the
        x- and y-axis of the input map.  Previously, $nx$ and $ny$
        had been interchanged, causing too little space to be
        allocated for the scratch file if $ny > nx$.
        Moved nowhere.

 5425.  November 9, 1989             MK3TX                Chris
        New task.  MK3TX allows the user to interactively select
        text files from a MKIII ("A" or "B") archive tape and
        convert them to disk-based text files acceptable to the
        local system.  Some of these files contain information
        that may be useful in editting and calibrating the data
        read from the tape with MK3IN.
        Moved nowhere.

 5426.  November 10, 1989            VLBIN                Phil
        Removed the ability to perform the correction for natural
        fringe rate differences between the two stations of a baseline.
        This was supposedly needed to line up the frequencies
        for the later running of CVEL on autocorrelation data.
        However I hadn't appreciated the fact that my routines in
        CVEL calulcate the shift for each station exactly and so
        implicitly do the natural fringe-rate correction anyway.
        Also changed the .HLP file.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5427.  November 12, 1989               CVEL                 Phil
        There was a problem with the direction of the 2 FFT routines used,
        the AIPS PSAP has a different direction to FOURG. Modified so
        they both assume the same sideband now. Also tidied up the
        informative error messages.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5428.  November 13, 1989              BPASS                Phil
        Fixed bug put in earlier. When initializing BP table entries
        was not checking number of polarizations being written. If
        there was only one some random variables were being clobbered.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5429.  November 13, 1989              UVFND                Bill J.
        Missing call to MSGWRT when compressed data was encountered
        let program die uninformatively.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5430.  November 13, 1989       Printer bugs                 Eric
        Corrected bugs in Friday's submission:
        AU1          Corrected spelling of variable name - was wrong type.
                     Corrected second call to PRTMSG for EXIT.
        PRTMSG       Added close and reopen of message file surrounding
                     the open of the line printer since that uses MSGWRT.
        ZLPOPN       (Generic) improved error message, corrected to return
                     an error code, added message giving file name when it
                     works correctly also.
        ZLASIO       (Generic) corrected message levels.
        TXPL         Corrected some more typing and wrong type of
                     variable in call to PRTLIN.
        POPSDAT.HLP  Removed a second declaration of RESTFREQ, it had
                     caused an addressing error of one location.
        Moved nowhere.

 5431.  November 14, 1989              UVFLG                  Phil
        Would not work under the circumstance that no source name was
        specified. If there were none an essential variable was left
        at 0 and since that was the loop index in the flagging do loop
        it didn't leave a lot for the task to do.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5432.  November 14, 1989       Fortran problems (SUN 4)     Bill C
        Fixed a number of problems in the task source code that were
        uncovered by the SUN 4 Compiler.  Arrainged by problem they
        were:
        - Lower case c as comment delimiter: COMB, FITTP, GREYS.
        - Declare an array passed as call argument as dimension (1)
          rather than (*): CALIB, CLIP, MCUBE, PCAL, XMOM.
        - Common variable target of DATA statment: CANPL, GAL, QMSPL,
          SOLCL, IMPFIT.
        - ANCAL needed to declare a type for DFLOAT
        - BSMAP had a SAVE statment after a DATA statment.
        - NINER used a 1-D subscript for WIND33 in an EQUIVALENCE when
          it was declared 2-D.
        In a number of cases the Sun compiler was out to lunch; in some
        cases a change was made to make the compiler complaint go away.
        - The most common of these was use of an array dimensioned (1)
          and equivalenced to a common array;  the VAX compiler
          disallows use of the dimension (*) in these cases so the
          dimensions were changed to a large value:  SDTUV, USUBA.
        - In JMFIT and IMFIT in the history routine RPARM was
          dimensioned (99) (it's true value) but the compiler was
          getting confused so the declaration was changed to (*).
          Moved nowhere.

 5433.  November 14, 1989             SPLIT                   Phil
        The alternate reference pixel written to the output catalogue
        header was incorrect by 1. Fixed.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5434.  November 14, 1989         Miscellaneous             Eric
        Corrected yet another call sequence to PRTMSG for CLRMSG in
        AU1.  Corrected lower case ``C'' in column one in Fortran
        files AU1A, AU5D, ZTPCLD (APLGEN:), CATIO, CHR2H, FILCR,
        PASWRD, SETVIS, VERMAT, PLNPUT, YGYHDR (YGEN:), and
        GRBOXS.  Corrected use of dummy array declaration length
        from (1) to (*) for call arguments in BDN and ITBSRT and
        to real lengths for local variables in GAINI and ITBSRT.
        Changed intrinsic DFLOAT to REAL in ZDHPRL.  Changed
        DATA of common variables in BMSHP to set the parameters
        at every entrance to the subroutine through equates.
        Changed a local COMMON to SAVE variables to allow the use
        of DATA for TABHDK and moved a SAVE statement in front of
        DATA statements in DATPOL.  All of these errors were found
        with an ANSI switch on the SUN 4/110; the VMS ANSI switch
        did not report these violations of Fortran standards.
        Moved the AU1 fix to NRAO1, rest to 15JAN90 this date.

 5435.  November 14, 1989            BPASS                   Phil
        Modified so that the interpolation across the bandpasses
        is now a user option, the default is not to do it. Changed
        .HLP file as well. Also changed the array declarations
        which were (1) to (*) as spotted by the Sun 4 compiler.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5436.  November 14, 1989         AIPS/SGLOCA                Glen
        A user found that Save/Get does not find a match when more
        than 10 names have the same first few characters.  SGLOCA
        now records up to 80 matchs and always detects an exact
        match to a requested Save/Get area.  Expanded error messages.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5437.  November 14, 1989        ALGSUB in MX, UVSUB          P. Leahy/Glen
        In GRIDDED execution of MX and UVSUB, for the last several months,
        a series of horziontal stripes were added to output images,
        because at U=0 ALGSUB was performing a complex conjugation
        when it should have been performing AP I/O.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5438.  November 14, 1989          VLBIN                   Phil
        Removed array declarations and a couple of intrinsic function
        calls that violated ANSI standard rules.
        Moved nowhere yet.

 5439.  November 14, 1989             VLBIN                    Phil
        When FFT'ing autocorrelation functions from the MPI correlator
        there was an error in calculating the ACF bias since the MPI
        software wrote the number of padded channels in the function
        not the number of channels containing data. Modified subroutine
        ACTRAN to run back through the data array to determine when the
        padding started and then calculate the bias using that.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5440.  November 14, 1989             TV routines                  Eric
        Changed IMANOT, IAXIS1, and IENHNS to use YSLECT rather than
        YGRAPH to turn on/off graphics planes.  The former uses YGRAPH
        but also sets the common variable TVLIMG which is used in TVFLG
        among other places.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5441.  November 15, 1989            Number parsing               Eric
        Changed GETNUM to require that there be a numeric character to be
        parsed in the specified string and to return an AIPS indefinite
        value (DBLANK) if there is not or if there is a floating overflow.
        Changed INQINT, INQFLT, and INQGEN to check for DBLANK and to
        return a negative error code if it occurs.  This will help detect
        user format errors in interactive tasks and service programs.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5442.  November 15, 1989          ALGSUB                        Glen
        Removed all complex conjugation near U=0 from ALGSUB.  Gridded
        and DFT MX using ALGSUB now agree to 1 part in 10 million for
        the test image of a 4 Jy calibrator with 256*256 pixels.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5443.  November 15, 1989          UVMAP                          Glen
        Increased buffer to allow 4096*2048 REAL maps, not just I*2 MAPS.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5444.  November 16, 1989          Free-format inputs          Eric
        Changed all programs that use free-format input through the
        INQGEN, INQINT, and INQFLT subroutines to test and use the new
        error return codes.  Changed AIPLAS, AIPMAN, DELSG, FILAIP,
        FILINI, FIXCAT, FIXUSR, GR2TEX, GRITP, POPSGN, RDFITS, RECAT,
        SETPAR, SETTVP, and UPDAT.  TVFLG remains out for other fixes.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5445.  November 16, 1989              VLBIN                  Phil
        In calculating the AC bias and removing it the output array
        was not being zeroed properly and some crap was coming through.
        Fixed.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5446.  November 16, 1989           SCREAT                  Eric
        Corrected error message to give ``too large'' disk sizes
        in 8-bit rather than ``AIPS'' bytes.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5447.  November 17, 1989           ITICS                   Eric
        Added a call to TICCOR to correct tick mark lengths for
        declination.  Lowered limits on lengths for small subimages.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5448.  November 17, 1989             TVFLG                  Eric
        (1) Corrected bugs related to having fewer than 4 graphics
        overlay planes.  It was possible for the menu to be erased
        without the menu routine being told about it.  The correction
        to IMANOT, made earlier, fixes a bug in which the graphics plane
        was not always turned on when needed.
        (2) Corrected handling of interactive window setting --- made it
        accept ``error'' returns for cursor off the image as at the
        outermost pixel of the current image.  I thought I had done this
        a year ago.
        (3) Added a dummy read of the cursor position to force the TV
        buffers to be flushed to the device.  Otherwise, graphics planes
        were left on when the program did things like prompt for
        term,inal input.
        (4) Changed an initialization so that the current menu selection
        gets highlighted again when the user returns to the menu mode.
        (5) Changed to handle format errors reading terminal input
        using the new error codes of INQINT et al.  This provides new
        exit methods from a couple of places.
        (6) Corrected TVFOAD to initialize the image catalog when it
        zeros the memory.
        (7) Corrected GRIDTB to compute the subarray number correctly;
        machine accuracy of 1 part in 10**8 or so was assumed.  The
        data for subarrays > 1 were not gridded correctly.  NOTE: this
        error is probably common throughout AIPS.
        (8) Corrected GRIDTB to set IRET error code on errors from
        GTBWRT; such errors went undetected by higher-level routines
        previously.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date, nowhere else.

 5449.  November 17, 1989               ACFIT                   Phil
        Debugged. It now will write an SN table containing the full
        time variable amplitude calibration factors for all antennas
        selected, will print various useful messages upon request,
        and also update the HI file.
        Also wrote the .HLP file.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5450.  November 17, 1989                UVFLG                   Phil
        In entry #5431 I missed one occurence of the setting of the
        number of sources. Fixed.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5451.  November 19, 1989             TVFLG                       Eric
        Corrected bugs in TVFOAD that caused the load by baseline length
        to fail.  When TVFOAD was rewritten for vectorization, the
        array indices for the second and third summing arrays were not
        modified for the baseline length, only the first was.  Also
        changed TVFLG to display the subarray number in the CURVALU-like
        display while flagging, to use a faster alogorithm to convert
        from length number to baseline number, and to display current
        selection of length vs baseline order with an asterisk if the
        next load will switch that selection.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5452.  November 20, 1989              TVFLG                  Eric
        A variety of changes:
        (1) Changed DOCAT so that a value of 2 with IN2SEQ = 0, means
            to return quickly, write the master grid file, and exit.
            This frees the user terminal during the lengthy creation
            of the restartable grid.
        (2) Added DOHIST option to control how much, if any, of the
            history is written.
        (3) Changed history times to sexagesimal format and limited
            the times in the history and flag tables to the start
            and stop times of the master grid.
        (4) Corrected overhaul bugs in the handling of strings giving
            the ``REASON'' for the flag and history files.
        (5) Corrected missing arguments to WRITE for some history
            cards and added a test on NPOINT greater than zero.  The
            latter made a confusing message on restarts.
        (6) Reordered operations in the menu-selection code to give
            the user control of the cursor before the menu is written.
        Modified the help file accordingly and the include DTVF.INC.
        Moved history corrections only to 15JAN90, nowhere.

 5453.  November 20, 1989             ACFIT                    Phil
        When removing a polynomial baseline, there was no trap to
        determine if the whole spectrum was flagged. Also there was
        an error in the printing out of the gain factor, the value
        written into the SN table was fine though.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5454.  November 20, 1989     Directory changes            Bill C.
        Created a new branch of the AIPS directory structure for
        non-release specific text files:
           VMS directory      Logical       Purpose
           [AIPS.TEXT.IONS]   AIPSIONS   Ionospheric monitoring data
           [AIPS.TEXT.PUBL]   AIPSPUBL   old DOCPUBL directory
           [AIPS.TEXT.GRIP]   AIPSGRIP   old DOCGRIP directory
           [AIPS.TEXT.WHO]    AIPSWHO    old DOCWHO directory
        As a part of this change the contents of TST:DOCPUBL, DOCGRIP and
        DOCWHO were moved to the new directories.
           Also created was a directory AIPS_VERSION:[INC.LOCAL] given
        logical name INCLOC.
           TVMON was moved from AIPS_VERSION:YVTVPGM to a new directory
        AIPS_VERSION:YPGVDEV ( [Y.PGM.VDEV])
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5455.  November 20, 1989     AIPSC                       Glen
        Modified AIPSC.FOR subroutine CHSTOP which called PRTMSG with
        the wrong number of arguments.  Added string ' ' in call to
        PRTMSG which is the File name to save line printer output.
        Moved nowhere.

 5455.  November 21, 1989        Service programs           Eric
        Changed GRKEY to offer the option of limiting the output
        to one or more keywords.  Changed GTTEX.COM to give an
        extra blank line for this option to GRKEY and to specify
        AIPSGRIP: rather then DOCGRIP:.  Changed in AIPGVMS:
        GRKEY, GETTBC, and GRSORT to specify AIPSGRIP: rather
        then DOCGRIP:.  Changed in AIPGVMS: ASORT, DIRECT, HOK,
        MAKDIF, and SURVEY  to specify AIPSWHO: rather then DOCWHO:.
        There are plenty of other places these changes should be
        made.  However, Bill Cotton does not give a shit so I am
        doing no more work on this.
        Moved nowhere.

 5456.  November 21, 1989      APLNOT:BPASET.FOR          Bill J.
        This routine didn't trap the case when both polarisations were
        flagged.  On normalisation of the table, divide by zeros
        were demanded.  This screwed up POSSM, HORUS and SPLIT amongst
        others.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5457.  November 21, 1989     Midnight job directory changes  Bill C.
        Changed UPDVMS:SRTUNQ.COM not to copy AIPSGRIP and AIPSWHO rather
        than DOCGRIP and DOCWHO.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5458.  November 22, 1989       BLREFM                        Phil
        The opcode in the call to TABBL was wrong when reformatting the
        tables.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5459.  November 22, 1989          TVFLG                     Eric
        Changed Fortran and Help:
        (1) To make FLAGVER default to 1, rather than the highest
            while reading the data and the highest+1 while writing
            the flags.
        (2) To write FLAGVER in the history file for all multi-source
            files; it used to do it only if calibration was applied.
        (3) Changed instructions in interactive flagging: buttons A
            and/or B cause a flag operation followed by a loop for
            more flagging choices and button D exits with no more
            flagging.
        (4) Changed interactive flagging so that button C means to
            do the currently indicated flagging and then return to
            the menu mode.  The CURVALU-like display will always be
            used.
        (5) Changed interactive clipping to use buttons A and B only
            to switch between max and min, button C to do the clipping
            before returning to the menu, and button D to return to
            the menu with no clipping.
        (6) Added a counter of number of master grid cells newly
            flagged by a command.  This is printed as a warning if 0
            or as information if greater than zero.
        Moved nowhere.

 5460.  November 22, 1989           Subarrays                  Phil
        There was a potential problem in the way in which we were
        determining the antenna numbers and subarray number. If
        significant rounding errors were occurring the wrong value
        would be picked up from the random parameter array. The
        following subroutines and tasks were changed:
           DATFLG, DATGET, DGETSD
           CLIP, CORER, FUDGE, UVFND, UVMTH, ACFIT, ASCOR, AVER,
           AVSPC, BLOAT, BSMAP, FILLM, INDXR, LISTR, MULTI, POSSM,
           USUBA, UVAVG, UVCOP, UVDGP, UVFIT, UVFIX, UVIMG, UVMOD,
           UVPLT, VBCAL, VBMRG, WTMOD, ASCAL, BLCAL, BPASS, CALIB,
           CVEL, PCAL, VSCAL
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5461.  November 22, 1989             MK3TX                 Chris
        Now recognizes filenames beginning with `[' to be text files
        (log files are stored with filenames of the form `[LOG??').
        Also increased the width of the numeric format in the summary
        line to cope with the fact that MK3 logs typically contain
        more than 1000 lines. In addition MK3TX no longer treats it
        as a fatal error if a file header does not contain the expected
        filename but asks the user whether he still wants to extract
        it since a few files from Bonn appear to have garbage in the
        file name field. Finally corrected to priority of an
        informational message which was being output at priority 8.
        Moved nowhere.

 5462.  November 24, 1989              YPGVDEV               Eric
        Renamed the link-editor file SYSVMS:YVTVPGMOPT.OPT to
        YPGVDEVOPT.OPT.  This is required to allow the task to link
        under VMS.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5463.  November 24, 1989            TV with Windows         Eric
        Changed AIPS TV model to allow for there to be a rectangular
        window as the view port into the (larger) TV memory.  Changed
        DTVC.INC     Added TVWIND(4), TVDUM2(4), reduced to YBUFF(160).
        YTVCIN       (YGEN) Init new parameters, changed YBUFF fill.
                     Also YDEA:, YM70:, YM75:, YIVAS:, and YSSS: versions.
        YWINDO       (YGEN) New routine to READ the window (and we hope
                     later to write it too).  Generic just returns the
                     image memory size.
        YWINDO       (YVTV) New routine to read/write over the wire.
        TVMON        Added interface for new YWINDO routine.
        AU6          Changed TVZOOM to center in window and reread
                     window size on button pushes.  Changed TVSCROL to
                     center in the window.  Changed TVPSEUDO to use
                     the window center and to scale everything by the
                     window size and to allow the window to change on
                     each button push.
        AU6A         Changed TVSPLIT and TVBLINK to start the split
                     screen in the middle of the window.
        AU6B         Changed to display the text based on the window at
                     the start of the CURVALUE algorithm.
        BLANK        Changed to start interactive bits from center of
                     window.  Image loading is based on TV image memory
                     size as always.
        BLSUM        Changed to start interactions at center of window.
        GRBOXS       Changed to start each box BLC at the center of window.
        GRLUTS       Scale the plot to the window, not the TV memory.
        GRPOLY       Start the cursor in the middle of the window.
        HIENH        Start the cursor in the middle of the window.
        HILUT        Changed the LUT slope and offset to be based
                     on the cursor position within the window.
        IENHNS       Changed the LUT slope and offset to be based
                     on the cursor position within the window.  Changed
                     the plot to be placed inside the current window.
        TVBLNK       Changed to base blink rate on current window.
        TVFIDL       Changed to do zoom, LUT, and OFM work relative
                     to the current window.  Button hits reread window
                     size.
        TVMOVI       Changed to base rate, enhancement, frame selection
                     relative to the current window.
        Unable to decide what to do with TVROAM, TVHXF, and TVHLD.  None
        of these work on current windowing machines, so just left them alone.
        Dropped unused include of DTVC.INC from SET1DG, ZARGXF, ZM70XF,
        ZV20XF, TKPL, XBASL, XGAUS, XPLOT, LTESS, STESS, TXPL, TKSLIN,
        and IMERG.  Cleaned up typing in TVWIND.
        Changed DISPTV, APCLN, APGS, APVC, MX, SDCLN, and STEER to put
        cursor up at center of window rather than at center of image
        memory.
        Moved nowhere.

 5464.  November 25, 1989            SSS windows               Eric
        Changed the SSS TV implementation to support the windowing
        scheme.  Changed:
        SSS.TXT    (SYSSUN:) Added OPCODE 14 to read/write window.
        HEADER.H   (YSVU:) Dropped declaration of cursor scaling parms
                   and interrupt handler.  Added WINDO (14) opcode.
        SSS.C      (YSVU:) Dropped init of cursor scaling parms.
        CURSOR.C   (YSVU:) Dropped cursor scaling and
                   {\tt cursor_choice} interrupt handler.  Added a
                   routine to force and to return the window size.
                   Added checks on excess window size, forcing it
                   back to coded maximum.
        WINDOW.C   (YSVU:) Dropped creation of panel buttons for cursor
                   scaling.
        SOCKXF.C   (YSVU:) Added handling for new opcode.
        Moved from MANDRILL this date after tests.

 5465.  November 25, 1989         Bugs                 Eric
        Corrected minor bugs in AU6B, GRBOXS, and TVMOVI affecting
        things when the window is smaller than the full screen.
        Also fixed error handling in YTVOPN (YGEN:) --- and error
        in YWINDO would leave the device partly open.
        Moved from MANDRILL this date.

 5466.  November 26, 1989            TVFLG                    Eric
        Changed TVFLG to use the YWINDO parameters as well in the
        various interactive enhancements, the CURVALU-like displays,
        and even in the placement of the main menu.  Improved the
        flexibility in the dynamic range of the interactive clip.
        Moved nowhere.

 5467.  November 27, 1989            SNPLT                    Phil
        Changed the tolerance slightly in defining the min and max
        delays to be plotted when there is no variation. The value used
        caused a fl.pt exception when the delay was constant and
        non-zero.
        Moved nowhere.

 5468.  November 28, 1989           ACFIT                    Phil
        Was writing the number of subarrays into the # antennas
        slot in the SN table header.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date,

 5469.  November 28, 1989           FILLM                    Glen
        Fixed Corruption of LP band observation of the Sun by
        subroutine MCSOLR.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5470.  November 28, 1989          FITTP                    Phil
        Removed a 'feature'; when FITTP read the FQ table it looked
        to see if there was only one row, if so it translated it to
        a CH table so older versions of AIPS could read it. The
        translation routine checked to see if there was only one IF
        and if so wrote nothing. Normally this is not a problem, but
        for some line experiments it means a frequency offset is lost.
        Modified so that a CH table is now always written.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5471.  November 28, 1989         TIMDEST                   Bill J.
        Incorrect arguments in call to PRTMSG in AIPSUB:AU3A.FOR
        caused AIPS to crash when TIMDEST was exercised.  The incorrect
        call arguments had not reflected the addition of an output
        file name for listing in subroutine PRTMSG.
        Moved nowhere.

 5472.  November 29, 1989          UVFIX                    Phil
        An index was wrong in the writing of compressed data.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5473.  November 29, 1989                VLBIN               Phil
        Increased the sizes of some arrays to cope with 288 channel
        autocorrelation spectra from the MkII correlator.
        Moved nowhere.

 5474.  November 29, 1989          DDTTEST.TEXT             Bill C.
        Added a documentation file to DOCTXT to be sent with the DDT
        tapes.  The current version refers to 15APR89.
        Moved nowhere.

 5475.  November 29, 1989           TABBL                   Phil
        Wrong index in array lead to incorrect number of IF's being
        written/read into/from BL tables.
        Moved to 15JAn90 this date.

 5476.  November 29, 1989           TACOP                   Bill J.
        If the 'OUT' file specification was set to defaults including
        OUTDISK=0, then the table to be copied was copied to the first
        disk with a suitable file - usually the wrong file!  Trapped
        this and forced write to input file.
        Moved nowhere.

 5477.  November 30, 1989            DCMP.INC,VISUNP,VISPCK     Phil
        New include and two simple utility routines. Include contains
        information needed for compression and decompression of vis.
        data. VISUNP will decompress data from one buffer to another,
        VISPCK will compress it in the same manner.
        Moved nowhere.

 5478.  November 30, 1989        YWINDO                  Eric
        Changed the generic YWINDO to return IERR = -1 on WRIT
        operations, meaning that writes cannot be done on the present
        device.  Returns IERR = 2 and a message, on bad opcodes.
        Moved nowhere.

 5479.  December 1, 1989              TVFLG                   Eric
        Corrected GRIDTB: when it was converted for vectorization, I
        suspect, the option to put the data in both as Ant1-Ant2 and
        as Ant2-Ant1 was subverted with no data going in the latter.
        Changed GRIDTB, TVFOAD, and TVFLG to keep time in the data
        row, changed TVFOAD to make a list of the actual times by
        row number in the TV disk file, and changed TVFLG to use that
        list in displays and in setting flag times.  Changed GRIDTB
        and TVFLG to keep a sort of ``weight'' with each datum in the
        master grid.  This weight is zero for good points.  Positive
        ``weights'' give the flag sequence number which deletes this
        datum.  Changed to accept up to two related Stokes parameters
        in the same master grid and to allow switching between them.
        Acceptable STOKES are all single ones (I, Q, U, V, RR, LL, RL,
        and LR) and double ones IV, QU, HALF, RLLR.  Both FULL and RRLL
        are taken to be HALF also.  Fixed help file for the Stokes
        change, including the change in menus.  Fixed TVFLG to keep a
        separate Stokes flag pattern for each flagging command, rather
        than a single one for all commands.
        Moved GRIDTB fix to 15JAN90, nothing else.

 5480.  December 1, 1989        Misc                      Eric
        Changed AIPINI to avoid disk access when called by FILAI2.
        Changed APLVMS:ZMKTMP to do a modulo 1000000 on the process
        ID.  Some VMS 5.n systems can have very high process IDs.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5481.  December 4, 1989       Makefile for SSS          Chris
        Added a makefile for SSS to directory YSVU. The Sun Screen
        Server may be rebuilt by typing
          make -f MAKEFILE new
        which recompiles all the SSS modules, link-edits SSS and
        moves it to LOAD. If `new' is omitted then only those modules
        that have been changed since the last rebuild will be
        recompiled. Macros must be defined in the MAKEFILE to supply
        the floating-point option for the linker (FPOPT) and the
        location of the AIPS CC script (CCDIR). The latter should not
        be necessary but the Sun make utility seems to lose the value
        of the command-search path (environmental variable PATH) ---
        I don't know whether this is a bug or a feature (Sun's make
        is non-standard). Also changed step (5) of the installation
        procedure in SSS.TXT (in directory SYSSUN) to reflect the
        existence of a makefile.
        Moved from the AOC Suns this date.

 5482.  December 4, 1989           TVFLG                    Eric
        Corrected serious bugs in new version: Changed dimension of
        time list in DTVF.INC and added check on that dimension in
        TVFOAD to avoid exceeding the array limits.  Corrected TVFOAD
        to leave a pointer fixed when averaging data; it updated it
        on every included row, making for bad times and bad data
        locations.  Changed TVFLG itself to give more indications
        of when current parameters will change on the next LOAD in
        the status line(s) given at the bottom of the menu.
        Moved from the VLA this date.

 5483.  December 5, 1989       ZTKCL2 in APLBERK               Kerry
        At some point in the evolution of SunOS 3.x, the disabling of
        exclusive use upon closing a terminal device quit working as
        advertised (i.e., closing the device should be sufficient).
        This meant that the second execution of a Tektronix oriented
        task or verb would still get a "device busy" error.  This has
        been averted now by adding an {\tt ioctl} call with TIOCNXCL on
        the device to explicitly relinquish exclusive before closing it.
        This should not be necessary, didn't used to be necessary and,
        at least under Convex OS 7.1, still isn't necessary, but should
        not cause a problem either.
        Change in 15JAN90 same date.

 5484.  December 5, 1989         SL2PL, plotting            Eric
        Corrected LABINI, SLBINI to use the passed length of their
        input character strings (as *(*)) rather than declare 80.
        This messed up SL2PL which had used length 132 strings.
        Cleaned up typing in SL2PL and removed improper declarations
        of dimensions as (1).
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5485.  December 5, 1989         OPCODE.HLP                 Eric
        Changed adverb help file to describe every task and verb
        which uses it including listing all allowed values of OPCODE.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5486.  December 6, 1989       ZMOUNT, ZMOUN2                  Bill J.
        Added argument NLUSER in call to ZMOUN2 from ZMOUNT specifically
        so that identification of tape allocation by AIPS user number
        could be made on CONVEXes.
        Moved nowhere.

 5487.  December 5--7, 1989       Times in history             Eric
        Changed the recording of the TIMERANG adverb in history files.
        All current code assumed that only the fourth and eighth parts
        of TIMERANG were non-integer, and most have odd ways of recording
        in history anyway.  So changed CORER and UVCOP to make
        more sensible displays.  Wrote a new subroutine HITIME
        to format TIMERANG to HI cards in both man- and
        machine-readable forms.  Changed ACFIT, BLCAL, BPASS, CALIB,
        CLCAL, CLCOR, CSCOR, CVEL, FARAD, FILLM, GETJY, HORUS, MK3IN,
        PCAL, QUACK, SDCAL, SOLCL, SPLIT, TABED, TVFLG, USUBA, UVIMG,
        and VLBIN to call HITIME.  Sent the fixes to CLCOR to Bill
        Cotton, the fixes to CVEL and UVIMG to Phil Diamond, and
        held back TVFLG for the moment.  Put the rest back.
        Moved nowhere.

 5488.  December 7, 1989         CGASET                        Bill C.
        Fixed an indexing problem for computing baseline dependent
        corrections for fringe rate errors.  This would cause problems
        for MKIII VLBI data only.
        Moved to 15JAN90 and 15OCT89 this date.

 5489.  December 7, 1989         UVMAP.HLP                     Bill J.
        Tweaked HELP file to remove an infelicity concerning UVBOX.
        Moved nowhere.

 5490.  December 7, 1989       CLCOR.FOR, CLCOR.HLP           Bill C.
        Added an option to correct CL table for an antenna position error.
        Delay, rate and phase are corrected.
        Moved nowhere.

 5491.  December 7, 1989           ZSPACE.C                   Bill J.
        This subroutine calculated size of users' files in kiloblocks
        using 'st_blocks' assuming that this is returned in units
        of 1024 byte blocks.  It isn't!  This makes for nonsense disk
        usage in the utility "SPACE".  Modified this to use 'st_size'
        which is in units of bytes so that we really know where we are.
        Moved nowhere.

 5492.  December 7, 1989            AU3A                     Phil
        Modified a call sequence to PRTMSG: DOCRT was being set to false,
        but the routine expected a real, this caused a bus error on the
        Convex.
        Moved nowhere.

 5493.  December 7, 1989          TVFLG                      Eric
        Corrected the addressing to the TV memory and to the master
        grid when flagging data with the clip option.
        Moved from the VLA.

 5494.  December 8, 1989              GPOS                  Kerry/Bill C.
        Fixed zero divide problem.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5495.  December 8, 1989              SNPLT                Kerry/Bill C.
        Fixed zero divide problem.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5496.  December 8, 1989        Documentation stuff             Bill
        PUTBCK the files used for the AIPSletter: AIPSPUBL:let89d.tex,
        al82.mac, order.tex,userform.tex(the user agreement form), and
        letform.tex (template AIPSLetter).
           Also various files related to the AIPSSERV distribution:
        - DOC:README.  General description of the files destributed by
        AIPSSERV.
        - AIPSPUBL:CHANGED.89D  CHANGE.DOC for the 15OCT89 release.
        - DOC:VMSNOTES.89D  VMS installation problem notes for 15OCT89.
        Moved nowhere.

 5497.  December 8, 1989       PRTAN                          Glen
        PRTAN now produces a shorter output if antenna mount, feed
        polarization and axis offsets are the same for all antennas.
        Also produces a VLA "Y" plot if all antennas are VLA antennas
        Moved nowhere.

 5498.  December 7--9, 1989       IF and channel numbers            Eric
        Corrected sloppy/wrong handling of IF numbers supplied by the
        user in ACFIT, BPASS, CLIP, CSCOR, GETJY, HORUS, LISTR, MX,
        PCAL, POSSM, SDCAL, SETJY, SNPLT, SOLCL, SPLIT, TVFLG, UFDIF,
        UVFIT, UVFLG, UVFND.  Corrected sloppy/wrong handling of channel
        numbers supplied by the user in ACFIT, AVSPC, BPASS, CALIB, CLIP,
        HORUS, LISTR, POSSM, PRTSD, SDCAL, SPLIT, TVFLG, UVCOP, UVDIF,
        UVFIT, UVFLG, UVFND.  Corrected typo in handling the IF for
        history writing in GRIDR.  Passed on changes of this sort in
        UVSUB and UVIMG to Phil who has them checked out and in VBPLT
        to Bill Junor for the same reason.
        Moved nowhere.

 5499.  December 8, 1989             GREYS                   Eric
        Corrected bug affecting plots where the two images did not
        identical header coordinates and dimensions.  The contour
        image header was used for the axis labeling which would
        produce a shift of the labels with respect to the plot.
        A call to SETLOC in this case could also produce trouble ---
        so saved not only the header but the whole location common
        and restored them at the end of GLAB.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5500.  December 9, 1989        Plot jobs                    Eric
        Corrected CNTR, PCNTR, and PROFL to restore a standard location
        common before calling the star plotting routine.  Non-default
        labeling options would have made the stars be plotted
        incorrectly.  Also made this change in KNTR, but, since it
        loops over planes, also had to restore the labeling version of
        the common after the call to STARPL.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5501.  December 9, 1989          Midnight job                Eric
        Changed UPDVMS:COPY.COM to handle the new directories called
        AIPS_ROOT:[AIPS.TEXT...].  Before, it only did names with
        AIPS_VERSION correctly.
        Moved from VAX1 this date to 15JAN90 and 15APR90.

 5502.  December 9, 1989         IMHEAD, QHEAD                Eric
        Changed LSTHDR and KWIKHD to make it clearer that the header
        extension file number if the maximum version number.  The old
        wording suggested that all lower version numbers existed
        which is not a requirement.
        Moved nowhere.

 5503.  December 9, 1989          PRTIM                     Eric
        Removed all limits on FACTOR from the help file.
        Moved nowhere.

 5504.  December 9, 1989          WTMOD                     Eric
        Cleaned up the typing some and changed it to avoid unflagging
        data.  Previously negative weights are altered, but remain
        negative.  Changed help file to clarify this.
        Moved to 15JAN90 since this is what users expected.

 5505.  December 9, 1989         BLANK                     Eric
        The TV loading function type was left out of the input
        parameters common causing BLANK to use the function type
        as an X increment in TV loads.  The function never was
        converted from HOLLERITH to CHARACTER either although the
        CHARACTER form was given to TVLOAD via the image header.
        Moved this fix only to 15JAN90 this date.

 5506.  December 10, 1989        ZMOUN2.C                 Bill J.
        I made a error in the filename in the DISMOUNT command
        which caused the failure of "DISMOUNT".
        Expansion of filename in 15APR90 only so moved nowhere.

 5507.  December 11, 1989     LOGIN.CSH and LOGIN.SH                Kerry
        Added the environment variable definitions for the new non-version
        specific directories (i.e., AIPSIONS, AIPSGRIP, AIPSPUBL and AIPSWHO).
        Added {\tt limit coredumpsize 0} to LOGIN.CSH so that {\tt core} files
        are never generated (don't know how to do this in LOGIN.SH for Bourne
        and Korn shells).  Also ``included'' environment variable definitions
        for local devices, however, this may saturate the environment on some
        systems.
        Change in 15JAN90 same date.

 5508.  December 11, 1989          $APLCVEX/ZMOUN2.C             Bill J.
        Tweaked tape logical name to be AIPSn.USERNOxxxx.INTAPEm so that
        the forced dismount on exit from AIPS made more sense.
        Moved nowhere.

 5509.  December 11, 1989          UVFND                      Eric
        Added two new options: (1) WTUV to give the maximum allowed
        weight, with visibilities haveing greater weights always
        printed.  And (2), APARM(5) > 0 means to check also the
        Hermitian box in 'UVBX' operation.  Corrected ``bug'' in
        the VCLP operation: APARM(3) was being used as the lower
        V-flux limit.  When a user said APARM = x to AIPS, then
        all samples were printed (being either greater than x
        or less than x).
        Moved nowhere.

 5510.  December 12, 1989             DBCON                    Phil
        Minor fix in DBCON. Under some circumstances it could blow up
        when attempting to determine the source number for single source
        compressed data if the array element it was looking in was a Nan.
        Changed so it only determines source numbers if it has to.
        Moved to 15JAN90 and 15OCT89 this date.

 5511.  December 12, 19899         $APLCVEX/ZMOUN2.C             Bill J.
        Forgot to switch the variables around appropriately.  This is
        what happens when fixes are put it at midnight!
        Moved nowhere.

 5512.  December 12, 1989          UVFIT                         Glen
        Incresed Vis buffers for UVFIT to 25000.
        Moved nowhere.

 5513.  December 12, 1989          UVIMG, GRIDTB                Eric
        Changed UVIMG and GRIDTB to set the error code to 0 before
        calling DATGET.  There is some way in which the error code
        is sometimes not reset by DATGET and this was causing UVIMG
        to quit when the first point not on the grid was encountered.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5514.  December 12, 1989            TVFLG                    Eric
        Corrected addressing error in recording the baseline number
        in the data arrays for later flagging.  The divide by 2 for
        2 values / cell had to become 3 now that weights are saved.
        Moved nowhere.

 5515.  December 13, 1989          CALREF                        Glen
        Bad data caused divide by zero.  Additional tests of data
        inserted.
        Moved nowhere.

 5516.  December 13, 1989            LISTR                        Phil
        Now explicitly checks to see if NX and SU tables are present
        when doing 'SCAN' listing.
        Moved nowhere.

 5517.  December 13, 1989             SPLIT                      Phil
        When copying the FQ table to the output file the offset for
        IF's was not being adjusted correctly, except for the 1st IF.
        This was causing problems later since the u,v,w's for IF's >
        1 would then be calculated wrongly.
        Moved to 15JAN90 and 15OCT89 this date.

 5518.  December 13, 1989            FILLR                       Bill J.
        The LOCAL INCLUDE 'FILLR.INC' had not been modified to reflect
        the inclusion of the FREQID column in the NX table.  This caused
        FILLR to generate a SU table with SOURCE ID = 1 for all sources
        in the file.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5519.  December 14, 1989             SWPOL                 Chris
        Rewritten to take care of the general case, where polarizations
        are swapped at a subset of the antennae in an array. SWPOL now
        handles compressed data and linear polarization. It also
        optionally rearranges calibration data in SN and CL tables.
        SWPOL is no longer capable of overwriting the input file and
        will no longer handle the case where two parallel hands are
        present but only one cross-hand (this is rather messy in the
        general case).
        Moved to area APGNOT this date.

 5520.  December 14, 1989               SPLIT                   Phil
        For some inexplicable reason SPLIT was not using the freq.
        offset from the SU table when writing the output file header
        and rescaling the u,v,w's. The frequency is now updated correctly
        for each source in SPLCOP.
        Moved to 15JAN90 and 15OCT89 this date.

 5521.  December 14, 1989           UVPLT                    Eric
        Corrected bug positioning the time-date string on the plot.
        It was one character too high.
        Moved to 15JAN90 and 15OCT89 this date.

 5522.  December 14, 1989           SSS                      Eric
        Changed YSVU: HEADER.H, CURSOR.C, and WINDOW.C to make the
        ``Resize'' panel button do something useful.  It will now
        pos between a full screen (actually a bit less, leaving some
        text window at the bottom) and the currently set smaller
        window including both size and location.
        Moved to SUN4 and SUN3 in CV, nowhere else.

 5523.  December 15, 1989          TBIN                       Glen
        TBIN now handles flagged data correctly.  Added subroutine
        TABREQ to APLNOT and modified TABAXI and TABHDK.  These
        subroutines do not pass arguments in common and are usable
        in other Programs.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5524.  December 18, 1989             SSS                        Eric
        Changed WINDOW.C to create the ``Resize'' button first.  That
        way it will still be visible on very tiny TV windows.
        Moved nowhere so far --- SSS will need rebuilding.

 5525.  December 19, 1989        FIXED.DOC                    Kerry
        Fixed UNIX documentation regarding setting area logicals.
        Moved to 15OCT89 December 20, 1989.

 5526.  December 20, 1989         TEC data                 Chris
        Checked in the Boulder TEC data from 1980 to mid-1989.
        Files are kept in the directory AIPSIONS and follow the
        naming scheme TECB.yy, where yy is the last two digits
        of the year. Also described these files in EXPLAIN FARAD.
        Moved nowhere.

 5527.  December 21, 1989   YGYHDR for IIS model 75   Claire Russell/Kerry
        Changed ``IF (IANGLE.EQ.1) THEN ...'' to ``IF (IANGLE.EQ.0) THEN ...''
        in the logic that determines which bits to turn on in the TV subunit
        header (apparently a error introduced during the conversion of an
        ``IF ... GO TO ...'' construct to an ``IF ... THEN ... ELSE ...").
        Changed in 15JAN90 same date, 15OCT89 December 22.

 5528.  December 22, 1989        UVPGET                    Bill C
        Fixed problem in format 1030.  This problem was causing programs
        to blow up if there was a problem with the random parameters in
        a data file.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5529.  December 22, 1989        UVFIX                         Bill C
        A logic error caused the UT1-UTC and IAT-UTC corrections set by
        the user to be ignored.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5530.  December 27, 1989         TVFLG                   Eric
        Changed DTVF.INC to add FC tables, GRIDTB to correct time
        computations for planes greater than one, TVFOAD to correct
        time setting for rows with no data, and GTBWRT to remove a
        blank line.  In TVFLG itself:
        (1) Added FC table to grid file.  This saves all Flag Commands
            to protect against aborts, TV failures, power failures,
            and the like.  Also, it allows deferring the application
            of the commands to data until a later execution (and
            allows applying the commands to more than one UV file).
        (2) Added options to LIST, UNDO, and REDO the flag commands.
            The last is needed to make sure that flagging of the
            master grid is consistent after some intermediate flag
            commands have been UNDOne.
        (3) Broke the CLIP flagging into a separate subroutine, which
            allows it to be REDOne as well.
        (4) Changed to pick up and use the master grid times in an
            array in memory.  This anticipates non-regular grids.
        (5) Changed to check current ``Stokes flag'' and to flag all
            planes in the master grid file that are affected.  When
            setting the Stokes flag, it checks to see if the current
            data (to be loaded next) is included.  Removes data from
            the TV and the TV data file only if the appropriate Stokes
            value is included in the Stokes flag.
        (6) Corrected flagging of the master grid file when doing
            boxes.
        (7) Corrected to reinitialize the graphics plane after a
            TVTRANSF operation.
        Changed TVFLG.HLP to reflect the various improvements.
        Moved from MANDRILL to CVAX and NRAO1 this date.

 5531.  December 27, 1989          TVFLG                    Eric
        Changed TVFLG to use IMCHAR to clear characters in the
        highlight graphics plane rather than YZERO.  The latter
        is slow on the IVAS.  Also fixed it to reset the graphics
        plane 2 string before exiting the menu.  Corrected GRIDTB
        to check for input uv data sets with only one Stokes and
        to use a correct Stokes for the grid file.  Corrected
        TVTRANSF display to zero the graphic planes used and to
        set a logical to recompute the menu only when there is
        just one graphics plane.  Added code to set BCHAN, ECHAN,
        BIF, EIF on restarts.  Corrected GRIDTB, it was trying
        to loop over too many channels and IFs.
        Moved from MANDRILL, test area on NRAO1.

 5532.  December 27, 1989  Type Declarations for EXTERNAL Routines  Kerry
        In addition to being declared EXTERNAL, such routines must also be
        given a (dummy) type declaration.  Otherwise, ``debug'' compilations
        (i.e., ``-g'') with the old ``bundled'' Sun f77 compiler will fail
        with the declaration error ``can't get dbx basetype information''.
        Sun's new ``unbundled'' FORTRAN 1.x does not have this problem.
        In the APLPGM program XGAUS, an INTEGER declaration has been added
        for the EXTERNAL subroutine FCN (passed as an argument to the routine
        LMSTR1).  Also, in the APLSUB routines LMDER and LMDER1, an INTEGER
        declaration has been added for the routine argument FCN.

 5533.  December 28, 1989          AIPSUB:AU8A                  Colin/Kerry
        In the section for listing info on plot extension files from VBPLT,
        the GO TO 303 should be GO TO 302.  Otherwise, missing antenna pair
        data causes loop 302 to terminate, perhaps prematurely.

 5534.  December 28, 1989          APLBELL:ZLOCK                Colin/Kerry
        The check for unavailability from a lockf() error return should be
        against EACCES, not EACESS.
        Changed in 15JAN90 same date.

 5535.  December 28, 1989          APLNOT:TABBP                 Colin/Kerry
        GO TO 50 should be GO TO 60.

 5536.  December 28, 1989          APLUNIX:ZABORS               Colin/Kerry
        The generic UNIX version of the abort handler was trying to use the
        external character array "sys_siglist" to extract the meaning of the
        caught signal, however, Bell UNIX systems have no such list.  If they
        do it's got another name.  Changed to simply report the number code
        of the caught signal.  Also changed the messages issued by the routine
        to say "ZABORS:" instead of "ZABOR2:" (i.e., the pre-overhaul name of
        this routine).  Also replaced the call to abort() with a call to
        kill() such that the process sends an illegal instruction to itself.
        There is no standard signal issued by the abort() function.  For
        example, Sun issues SIGIOT whereas most other implementations issue
        SIGILL.  IOT and EMT are PDP-11 instruction mnemonics and therefore
        not issued on Suns, so Sun chose to use it for this purpose.  This
        is not totally screwy.  POSIX will probably replace SIGIOT with
        SIGABRT.
        Changed 15JAN90 same date.

 5537.  December 28, 1989          APLUNIX:ZFRE2                Colin/Kerry
        Replaced the call to index(), which is Berkeley UNIX specific, with
        a trivial, portable loop.
        Changed in 15JAN90 same date.

 5538.  December 28, 1989        ZCREAT                  Eric
        Cleaned up the error messages in APLGEN: version of ZCREAT.

 5539.  December 30, 1989             UVDIF                     Chris
        Corrected declaration of LPNAME to be 48 characters.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date

 5540.  January 1, 1990        TIMDEST, ZOPEN                 Eric
        Changed AU3A to send a blank character string rather than an
        integer 0 as the task name to PRTMSG to delete messages.  The
        Convex anyway, took it to be some (nonexistant) task name.
        Changed ZOPEN to declare the file name as character *(*) rather
        than *48.  This is important for dummy names and the like.
        Moved changes to 15JAN90 this date.

 5541.  January 2, 1990               PRTAB                     Bill C.
        Increased the maximum number of keyword/value pairs to 1024

 5542.  January 2, 1990               TABED                     Bill C.
        Increase the maximum number of Keyword/value pairs allowed
        when creating a new table.  Also now checks that the maximum
        is not exceeded.
        Moved nowhere.

 5543.  January 2, 1990            APLUNIX:ZCMPR2               Colin/Kerry
        Fixed error in null terminating the translated logical part of the
        physical file name (i.e., changed "xlated[tlen]" to "xlated[xlnb]").
        Also, changed PMODE to 0666 (i.e., owner, group & world readable &
        writeable), replaced obsolete reference to the former name of this
        routine (ZQTRUN), removed calls to "sync" (synchronizes the super-
        block) and changed the calculation of the number of bytes in an AIPS
        block to "256 * sizeof (int)".
        Changed in 15OCT89 and 15JAN90 same date.

 5544.  January 2, 1990            APLBELL:ZABOR2               Colin/Kerry
        This is a new, Bell UNIX specific version.  It differs in that the
        signal SIGCLD (death of a child) is ignored.  Under Bell UNIX, ignoring
        SIGCLD prevents terminated child processes from becoming zombies that
        are then erroneously reported by the task query mechanism (i.e.,
        ZTACT2) as still active.  The only problem with this is that, although
        it is still supported on many System V-based systems (e.g., HP-UX, Cray
        UNICOS, Masscomp RTU), SIGCLD is not part of the SVID (System V
        Interface Definition) and programmers are discouraged from using it
        in new products.  The POSIX draft says "applications should set the
        action for this signal to SIG_DFL in order to ignore it"???
        Moved to 15OCT89 and 15JAN90 same date.

 5545.  January 4, 1990          FQMATC                      Eric
        Changed it to give its ``setting FQ id number'' message only
        when there is more than one possibility.
        Moved nowhere.

 5546.  January 4, 1989              NXTFLG                   Eric
        Corrected error.  To decide whether to include a given FG table
        entry it was searching a list of 30 included source numbers if
        any had been specified (via SOURCES, CALCODE, or however).  It
        did not check for more sources if there were more and it did
        not check for the flag being source independent.  Changed to
        check source independence first and then to test the actual
        number of source IDs in the list when the flag is source
        dependent.  The full calibration system must be relinked.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5547.  January 4, 1990        TVFLG's friends             Eric
        Changed and corrected:
        DTVF.INC  Added new adverb for CALCODE, changed to allow 16384
                  rather than 8192 times, added DOWEDG, added list of
                  source numbers by master-grid row and put the max
                  source number in common.
        GRIDTB  Added list of begin times of each row to call sequence
                and option to compute the list at regular intervals
                inside GRIDTB.  Changed to store 2 times per row.
                Changed to use time list rather than regular time
                intervals for gridding.  Changed calls to GTBWRT.
        GTBWRT  It was averaging over much too large a write buffer
                and thereby writing over a lot of core.  It took the
                Convex with 8 spectral-line channels to reveal this.
                Added list of start times for each row to call
                sequence.  Changed to store two times from this
                list in each row rather than averaging sample times.
                Corrected to find max and min over all buffers rather
                than testing buffer 1 Nbuffers times.
        TVFOAD  Changed to put correct units in the TV file header.
                Changed to compute a list of start times for each
                TV-file row based on the integration time and avoiding
                any averaging of different sources.  Changed to use
                2 times per row in the master and TV files.  Added
                call to load optional step wedge.
        UVIMG   Added time array to call to GRIDTB and code to have
                GRIDTB compute it as a regular array.
        Moved nowhere.

 5548.  January 4, 1989              TVFLG                      Eric
        Changed:
        (1) Added CALCODE adverb to allow selection by calibrator code
            including '-CAL' for no calibrators.
        (2) Changed it to grid the master grid file at as regular grid
            intervals as possible, but to allow it to be irregular to
            avoid running sources together or having many consecutive
            empty rows.  Changed the TV gridding to do the same.
        (3) Added an option step wedge in the display.
        (4) Added ``CLIP BY FORM'' operation.  This allows you to apply
            the ``form'' of a clip operation, i.e., the averaging time,
            type of data clipped against (e.g., rms), and the clip
            limits, to a selected set of other channels and IFs using
            the data of those channels and IFs.
        Code changes: added code to compute times for master grid before
        calling GRIDTB.  Corrected seting of UV file parameters to be
        before the call to SOUFIL.  Improved the times used to be in
        more pleasing intervals if possible (limits set at integer 1
        or 10 seconds).  Changed to 2 times and source number in each
        row of master grid and 2 times in each row of TV file.  Added
        some times for rows after the data --- all times are now based
        on semi-regular intervals rather than an average of the sample
        times.  Added TVFWED subroutine to do step wedge writing and
        erasing.  Added subroutine TVFBOX to replace the more general
        and unforgiving GRBOXS.  TVFBOX limits the box display and
        parms to the range actually on the TV, allowing easy graphical
        setting of windows.  Added double check and warning when
        exiting TVFLG without applying the flags while the master grid
        is a scratch file.  Corrected display at bottom of master grid
        --- the wrong asterisk was checked for baseline ordering.
        Corrected CURVALU-like display to blank source name when the
        row has no source name and to display a line only if it has
        changed (making the action peppier).  Cleaned up unused variables
        and statement labels.  Improved error messages.  Changed meaning
        of times to beginning time of row, thereby using averaging of this
        row and next as the average time.  Corrected CLIP limit read
        to use the required double-precision argument to INQFLT.
        Changed LIST FLAGS and UNDO FLAGS to inquire about flag number
        only when there is a choice.
        Moved nowhere.

 5549.  January 4, 1990            DOC:UNIXNOTES.89D                Kerry
        Created file containing solutions to several problems encountered by
        sites while installing the 15OCT89 release on UNIX systems (mostly
        Sun VTV, abort handler, Tektronix and tape interface issues).  Made
        a hard copy for Ernie to include in any remaining or future orders
        for 15OCT89.
        Moved to 15OCT89 same date.

 5550.  January 5, 1990        TABBP                        Bill C.
        Cleaned up typing and some declarations.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5551.  January 5, 1990         BLGET                        Bill C.
        Cleaned up a problem with nested DO loops with a common termination
        and GO TOs to loop terminator.  This caused trouble on HP compilers.
        Also cleaded up typing and declarations.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5552.  January 5, 1990        EXTINI, TABINI                 Eric
        When a file's catalog slot is renumbered, the file names
        stored in the headers of the old and new table format files
        are not changed.  Thus, when TABINI and EXTINI open an old
        table, they need to force the name in the header to match
        the current name.  Changed it to do so.  Relink the system.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5553.  January 5, 1990        Logical version ID             Eric
        Changed things to determine the logical version identification
        (TST, NEW, OLD) of the current execution and to record that
        in the ACcounting file.  Changed:
        DMSG.INC   Renamed a dummy variable MSGVER.
        ACOUNT     Changed to call ZVERSN, put MSGVER in ACcount
                   file, display value as string on task termination.
        ZVERSN     APLGEN: version to determine the logical (NEW, OLD
                   or TST) matching the RLSNAM string.
        PRTAC      Changed to support free format inputs, a staff
                   list of user numbers, sum and loop over versions,
                   and numerous minor fix ups.
        PRTAC.HLP  Added DOALL to choose between lumping all versions
                   together and displaying them separately.
        STAFF.001  Put a list of NRAO staff user numbers in RUNSYS
                   for use by PRTAC (in its stand-alone mode).
        Need to relink system as for NXTFLG and TABINI/EXTINI anyway.
        Moved nowhere.

 5554.  January 8, 1990           TVFLG                     Eric
        Corrected bugs that:
        (1) caused the ANTENNA-DT mode to clear the wrong TV pixels
            although the correct pixels were cleared in the TV and
            master files,
        (2) fail to flag anything in the master file on the PIXEL
            mode (telling you that it failed for a GETIME error), and
        (3) displayed only the begin time for PIXEL flags in the SHOW
            FLAGS function.
        Moved nowhere.

 5555.  January 8, 1990             SNPLT                      Chris
        Fixed a bug in the time axis scaling: the difference between
        the maximum and minimum on the y-axis was being used instead
        of the difference between the maximum and minimum on the
        x-axis.
        Changed in 15JAN90 this date.

 5556.  January 9, 1990             ANCAL                Chris
        ANCAL has been modified so that it can calibrate more than one
        IF in a single run thus making the calibration of MkIII VLBI
        data much less tedious. Two new keywords, BIF and EIF, have
        been added to the control card to give the first and last IF
        for which calibration information is present; IFNO is retained
        for compatibility with older calibration files (IFNO=n is
        equivalent to BIF=n EIF=n). T-sys entries now consist of a
        day number, a time and NIF T-sys values where NIF is the
        number of IFs to be calibrated: the first T-sys value applies
        to IF BIF, the second to IF BIF+1 and so on. In addition ANCAL
        now checks whether gain entries in the CL table are invalid
        (equal to FBLANK) before multiplying them by the calibration
        factor. Files changed are
           APGNOT:ANCAL.FOR
           APLNOT:TYINI.FOR
           APLNOT:TABTY.FOR
           HLPFIL:ANCAL.HLP
        Moved nowhere. FBLANK bug fixed in 15JAN90 this date.

 5557.  January 9, 1990        PRTUV                         Bill C.
        Fixed problem that occured when more than 30 sources were present
        in a uv data file.  Now will work on compressed data. Also
        restructured the task and divided it up into a number of
        subroutines.
        Moved nowhere.

 5558.  January 9, 1990      AIPSUB:GETFLD               Bill C.
        Moved error trap before processing output variable from GETNUM.
        In the case that a character string starting with "." was typed
        in (specifically ".false.") GETNUM was detecting a bad value and
        setting the output to DBLANK which was overflowing a single
        precision word on IEEE machines; causing an abort.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5559.  January 9, 1990       TVFLG                     Eric
        Changed DTVF.INC and TVFLG to produce correct prompt messages
        for entering channels and IFs.  They are supposed to be
        between BCHAN and ECHAN and between BIF and EIF, resp.
        Corrected numerous places to take into account that the
        reference value for baseline number may not be one (when a
        SUBARR greater than 1 is specified).
        Moved from Mandrill, nowhere else.

 5560.  January 10, 1990       RSTOR                   Bill C.
        Fixed problem in computing size for scratch files when the
        two dimensions of the image were different.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5561.  January 10, 1990        TVSLV                  Bill C.
        Copied TVSLD to [aips.local.dead.pgm] and .hlp] and removed
        from both NEW and TST.  This task apparently survived the
        last purge of software that didn't survive the overhaul.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5562.  January 10, 1990           TVFLG                  Eric
        Found errors in GRIDTB addressing more difficult Stokes types
        and when dividing by flux.  I doubt that these caused any
        real trouble.
        Moved nowhere.

 5563.  January 11, 1990        UVFLG                   Bill J.
        Added a 'mask' option to UVFLG so that users could flag any
        combination of RR, LL, RL and LR that they like.  There are
        situations where the user would like to flag all cross-hand
        fringes but this was not possible in UVFLG --- STOKES 'RL'
        and 'LR' flagged 'RL' AND 'RR' and 'LR' AND 'LL'
        respectively.  Specifying a suitable mask in the STOKES
        adverb e.g. '0011' will now flag appropriately.  Also
        modified UVFLG.HLP to reflect these changes and explain
        existing options a little better.
        Moved nowhere.

 5564.  January 11, 1990       UVSUB                   Phil
        Increased the buffer sizes to cope with 4096 square
        images.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5565.  January 11, 1990         COOK10.TEX                Phil
        Rewrote the VLBI chapter of the cookbook. It now provides
        user recipes for the reduction of VLBI data using the calibration
        package. It also includes a section on spectral line VLBI data
        reduction. Full polarization and Mk3 analysis will follow soon.

 5566.  January 11, 1990          TVFLG                    Eric
        Corrected handling of the baseline order parameters.  The were
        confused and partly wrong, including in the recorded baseline
        in the FC table.  Changed TVFOAD as well as TVFLG.  Also
        improved the prompt message on the Flag/Confirm function.
        Moved nowhere.

 5567.  January 12, 1990        FILAI2, ZDIR            Eric
        Corrected FILAI2, it used the wrong arguments to a WRITE
        statement, thereby blowing a FORMAT.  Brought the initialization
        statements for the accounting file up to date.  Changed
        ZDIR (APLVMS: version) to append a period to the file names
        from the root area ('RT').  Otherwise, FILAI2 was seeking
        SYSPARM.DAT.
        Moved to 15JAN90 today.

 5568.  January 13, 1990     DOC:VMSNOTES.89D                  Bill C.
        Included documentation about problems with FILAI2 and printers.
        Moved nowhere.

 5569.  January 14, 1990          TVFLG, GRIDTB, GTBWRT        Eric
        Changed call sequence to GTBWRT to pass the first dimension
        of the summing arrays as a parameter and changed that call
        in GRIDTB.  Corrected two errors in TVFLG --- to display the
        flagged time-range on mode 'TIME' when listing flags and to
        compute even more times in the master time list to avoid
        hitting the end of the list.
        Moved nowhere.

 5570.  January 14, 1990           SPFLG                     Eric
        Files: SPFLG.FOR, SPFLG.HLP, GRIDTC.FOR and SPFOAD.FOR (last
        2 may may vectorize).  New task to display channel on the x
        axis and time on the y axis and then to edit the data much
        like TVFLG.  So far, the task will work on only one baseline
        at a time.
        Moved nowhere.

 5571.  January 15, 1990          BPASS                       Bill C.
        Changed arguments in call to BPADJ.  There was a bug which caused
        the routine to fail and die with an error message.  BPADJ
        is called when there are multiple reference antennas used i.e.
        when REFANT was not specified.
        Moved to 15JAN90.

5572.  January 15, 1990       FILLM                      Bill C
        Fixed several problems with Frequency accountability.
        There was some difficulty associated with using the
        frequency of the first channel written to AIPS as the
        reference frequency.  The frequency offset of the first IF and
        source were half the bandwidth since the frequency of the
        observations used was the band center frequency.  However, in
        computing the source and Doppler frequency offsets the sky
        frequency rather than the reference frequency was used.
        FILLM now uses the frequency channel corresponding to the
        center of the observed band to be used as the reference pixel in
        the output files and the first encountered "sky" frequency as
        the reference frequency.  Also there were numerous errors
        handling FQ identifiers.
           Use of STFREQ as the stream reference frequency was changed
        to use the value in the catalog header since STFREQ may contain
        a different value if processing of data into a given file is
        restarted.
           A major restructuring of the way SU, FQ and CL tables are
        processed was made.  These tables are now written by a new
        routine FLMTAB which is normally called from FLMUV but for the
        last entries in the CL table it is called from MCHEAD.
           Revised the was averaging was handled; usually data was not
        being averaged as requested.  Also fixed a bug in the handling
        of shadowing; the default was no flagging rather than 25 m.
        Now makes the frequency reference pixel the velocity, alternate
        axis reference pixel.
        Moved nowhere.

 5573.  January 15, 1990         MX.FOR, MX.HLP               Bill C.
        Fixed error in passing the alternate reference axis pixel.  It
        was not correcting for selection by channel.  Also changed the
        Adverbs  for specifying line channels to a more standard useage
        (BCHAN and ECHAN select channels).
        Moved nowhere.

 5574.  January 15, 1990            UVCOP                     Bill C.
        Changed how frequency labeling was handled.  The same reference
        frequency as is input file is now used and the reference pixel
        changed.
        Moved nowhere.

 5575.  January 15, 1990         SPLIT                      Bill C.
        Fixed error in assigning alternate reference pixel for
        the velocity axis. Now assumes that the velocity reference
        pixel is the same as the frequency reference pixel.  Now
        no correction is made for source dependent frequency offsets
        in the reference frequency but it is done in DGHEAD.  Source
        dependent frequency offsets are put into the FQ table.
        Moved nowhere.

 5576.  January 15, 1990          DGHEAD                     Bill C.
        Changed the handling of the frequency reference pixel.  The same
        channel is now used in the input and output data.  The old scheme
        was to shift the reference frequency but the reference pixel was
        not changed.  Also, now the source frequency offset is added to the
        the Reference frequency if the output is for a single source and
        there is an input SU table.
        Moved nowhere.

 5577.  January 15, 1990            HORUS                    Bill C.
        Cleaned up handling of the frequency reference pixel.  It is now
        set only in IMCREA and ignores the value set by DGHEAD.
        Moved nowhere.

 5578.  January 15, 1990            FILAI2                    Eric
        Changed it to use LUN 6 for messages since it is run in batch
        where LUN 5 is only an input device.  There is no interactivity
        in this program.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5579.  January 16, 1990           SPFLG, TVFLG                Eric
        Fixed some messages which were too long in both SPFLG and
        TVFLG and corrected the wording of some messages (``channel''
        should be ``baseline'') in SPFLG.  Changed SPFLG.HLP to
        explain the current, nonstandard use of ANTENNAS and BASELINE.
        Changed GRIDTC and SPFLG to do two baselines at a time (where
        the baseline axis can remain regular).
        Moved nowhere.

 5580.  January 16, 1990             TBAVG                   Bill C.
        New task.  TBAVG averages uv data over time and baseline to
        produce a new uv data file.  This is useful for measuring flux
        densities of time variable point sources.  Also TBAVG.HLP.
        Moved nowhere.

 5581.  January 17, 1990          UVFLG                        Bill C.
        Modified so the channel range written to an FG table were the values
        passed from AIPS.  This is to allow flagging a "channel 0" data file
        with entries suitable for copying to a line data base without
        further editing.  Also cleaned up declarations.
        Moved nowhere.

 5582.  January 18, 1990             TVFLG                     Eric
        Added to the help file and code an option to allow
        autocorrelation data.  Before, it was included on the baseline
        axis, but disallowed by the defaults in the calibration package.
        Also corrected a bug in setting the internal stop time.  When a
        TIMERANGE was used, the master grid would usually stop prematurely
        until this fix.  Changed most of the numeric inquiry functions to
        return to the menu on non-numeric input, rather than repeating
        the question.  This allows the user to bail out.
        Moved nowhere.

 5583.  January 18, 1990            SPFLG                     Eric
        Corrected bug in setting stop times and added option to help
        file and code to allow autocorrelation data.  Changed to
        support ANTENNAS and BASELINE in the usual fashion and to
        have as many baselines in the master grid as you may desire.
        They are put on an irregular axis whose coordinates are stored
        in a TB extension table.  Only allowed baselines with data are
        included.  Added a display to show the correspondence between
        this ``random'' baseline number and real antenna numbers.
        Moved nowhere.

 5584.  January 18, 1990               VLBIN               Dan Briggs/Phil
        Dan spotted an error in the fbs correction routine that remained
        from the overhaul, it used to be a pseudo I*4 section which was
        erroneosly erased and caused the fbs correction to fail.
        Also tidied up the autocorrelation transform routine.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5585.  January 18, 1990               UVGRID              Glen
        Set zero spacing flux to 1. for creating a beam.  Added new
        general subroutines which handel bandwidth synthesis averageing:
        UVZERO sets a vis point to zero, except U value.
        UVZRSP sets zero spacing flux.
        UVCONJ performs complex conjigate of one vis point
        UVSETB sets values for creating synthesized beam from VIS.
        Moved to 15JAN90 on January 19, 1990.

 5586.  January 19, 1990   UVHGM.FOR,UVHGM.HLP  Mark Calabretta/Bill C.
        Fixed a number of bugs and added the option to plot frequency (FQ)
        id.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5587.  January 19, 1990   QPUT                                Glen
        Added wait after QPUT in FPS version
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5588.  January 19, 1990         HITIME                  Eric
        A bad declaration --- some variable should have been integer,
        but were listed as real --- caused a formatting error (as well
        as poor history cards).
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5589.  January 20, 1990   UVGRID/UVCONJ                       Glen
        Modifed UVCONJ to conjugate all stokes as well as all
        frequency channels, if requested.  UVGRID call to UVCONJ modified.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5590.  January 20, 1990   ALGSUB                              Glen
        Replaced some GO TOs by THEN, END IFs and added calls to UVCONJ
        Moved nowhere.

 5591.  January  20, 1990         FUDGE                       Bill C.
        Modified to process compresed data; if the input data is compressed
        then the output will be compressed.  Also modified to make it
        easier to write different size output records from the input.
        Moved nowhere.

 5592.  January 20, 1990         TBAVG.FOR,TBAVG.HLP         Bill C.
        Modified to process compressed data and fixed a couple of bugs
        in the handling of flagged input data.  Fixed a description of
        the task in TBAVG.HLP.
        Moved nowhere.

 5593.  January 20, 1990     UVBAS.FOR,UVBAS.HLP  Bill C/Huib van Langevelde
        New task.  Determines a "continuum" visibility from the average
        of a specified set of channels and subtracts it from all spectral
        channels.  This task is useful for removing continuum emission from
        line data.  It works properly only if the visibility of the source
        does not change significantly across the bandpass.
        Moved nowhere.

 5594.  January 21, 1990       FILLM.FOR                      Bill J./Bill C.
        Added Bill C.'s fixes (1) to make FILLM do shadow flagging correctly
        and (2) to correct blowing up of format when FQ tolerance is large.
        Moved to 15JAN90 this date.

 5595.  January 22, 1990    UNICOS Area Logicals                       Kerry
        Added area logicals to $SYSAIPS/AREAS.DAT for the implementation of
        AIPS under UNICOS.  These include $APLCRI (UNICOS Z-routines), $INCCRI
        (UNICOS INCLUDE files), $QCRI (UNICOS Q-routines) & $SYSCRI (UNICOS
        system files).  Eliminated the UNIX area logicals for empty, never used
        directories, including $APLNUNIX, $QPGUNIX, $QYPGUNIX, $SYSLUNIX and
        $YPGUNIX.  Also cleaned up and embellished the comments.

        To be distributed in 15JAN90 installation kits for UNIX.

 5596.  January 22, 1990    Source Code Preprocessing for UNICOS       Kerry
        Source code preprocessing for FORTRAN modules under UNICOS is the
        same as for any other system, however, C modules require some minor
        massaging, including the removable of the ``_'' (underscore) suffix
        from entry points and calls to FORTRAN routines.  Also, ``cft77''
        does NOT convert FORTRAN code to lowercase, so entry points and
        calls to other AIPS routines must be specified using uppercase.
        The UNICOS version of PP does this via ``sed'' using the command
        file C.SED.  A special version of INCS.SH has also been created
        that includes the $INCCRI directory in the preprocessor's search
        path for INCLUDE files.
        New files: $SYSCRI/PP
                   $SYSCRI/INCS.SH

 5597.  January 22, 1990    Compiler & Loader Options for UNICOS       Kerry
        Created options files specifying rather ``vanilla'' defaults for
        UNICOS ``cc'' (C) and ``cft77'' (FORTRAN) compilations plus
        ``segldr'' program loading (linking).
        New files: $SYSCRI/CCOPTS.SH

 5598.  January 22, 1990    Object Library Maintenance for UNICOS      Kerry
        System V based UNIX platforms do not have ``ranlib'' (eliminated
        after SYSTEM III).  Furthermore, UNICOS uses ``bld'' as an object
        librarian rather than the standard UNIX ``ar''.

 5599.  January 22, 1990    ZLPCL2 Script for UNICOS                   Kerry
        Created a special version of the standard UNIX script used to dispose
        line printer output (i.e., temporary disk files) to a suitable device.
        It's very similar to the generic UNIX version, except it uses the
        UNICOS ``asa'' filter to process FORTRAN carriage control characters.

 5600.  January 22, 1990    FORTRAN Compilation Script for UNICOS      Kerry
        The technique used in the generic UNIX version of this script to
        detect a FORTRAN compilation failure does not work under UNICOS (i.e.,
        ``cft77'' produces a ``.o'' file whether it fails or not), thus a
        special version of the FC script that tests the return code of the
        compiler.
        New file: $SYSCRI/FC

        To be distributed in 15JAN90 installation kits for UNIX.

 5601.  January 22, 1990  Source & Object Library Mappings for UNICOS  Kerry
        Created a generic version of LIBR.DAT for UNICOS that uses the $QCRI
        Q-routines, the $YVTV (virtual TV) Y-routines and $APLCRI Z-routines.
        New file: $SYSCRI/LIBR.DAT

 5602.  January 23, 1990            UVBAS                 Bill C.
        Corrected indexing error when selection channels.  It was selecting
        data starting at channel 1.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5602.  January 23, 1990         DeAnza routines     Mark Calabretta/Eric
        Corrected YDEA errors in YZERO (constant used in call where
        variable is required) and YSPLIT (NE used where EQ was wanted).
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5603.  January 23, 1990        EXPFIT                 Eric
        Corrected bad format numbers and added further directory name
        tests.  Changed EXPFIT.COM to include the new text regions.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5604.  January 24, 1990           SPFLG                  Eric
        Corrected the CURVALU-like display in most of the flagging modes.
        It was not handling BCHAN correctly.

 5605.  January 24, 1990     UVBAS.HLP  Huib van Langevelde/Bill C.
        Added explain section.

 5606.  January 25, 1990         BATER                    Bill J.
        Two calls to CHR2H in subroutine CUA had incorrect numbers

 5608.  January 29, 1990          PLCUB                   Bill J.
        The call to NAMEST used a hollerith rather than a character
        string although the necessary conversion had been performed.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5609.  January 30, 1990          BATER                   Bill J.
        Due to indexing error in subroutine BATPOL, the command
        interpreter could never have worked for some while!
        Moved from 15APR90 this date.

 5610.  January 31, 1990        LISTR.HLP     M. Calabretta/Bill C
        Corrected misstatements about the defaults for frequency
        identifier.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5611.  January 31, 1990       APGNOT:UVPLT   M. Calabretta/Bill C
        Fixed a formatting problem in displaying the timerange on the
        plot; scaled the u,v, and w to the correct frequency when they
        are plotted and allowed plotting all FQ ids on the same plot.
        Also documented in UVPLT.HLP.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5612.  January 31, 1990        DDTs                    Glen
        Removed NPOINTS from the DDTSAVE help and from DDTLOAD.001.
        Updated DDT.HLP.  Modified NEWPARMS.001 to include the
        DDT adverbs DDISK, DDTSIZE, EDGSKP, IOTAPE, MDISK, TCODE,
        TDISK, TMASK and TMODE.  Added help files for the adverbs.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5613.  February 6, 1990          CALIB                    Bill
        Changed call to FRQTAB in GASOLV to determine frequencies from
        the actual file being read rather than the input data file.
        Since the data may be reordered by UVGET this is important;
        under some circumstances this problem causes an infinite loop.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5614.  February 9, 1990          CALIB                    Bill C
        Fixed a couple of MIN functions that were supposed to be MAX
        in CLBSRC and CLBDR.  This error caused CALIIB to abort when
        doing a common delay-rate solution for all IFs in a MkIII data
        file.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5615.  February 9, 1990        MK3IN.FOR,MK3IN.HLP     Bill C.
        Numerous improvments.  Any antennas found may be selected by
        using antenna name 'ANY' in the INFILE.  The "Debug" output
        option was cleaned up to work properly on any machine.  CL table
        entries for antennas for which there was no data are no longer
        written.  The observing date in the AN and HI files are now
        correct.  The time tags associated with the first baseline of
        the first scan are now correct if REFDATE is not specified.
            The phase of the phase cal was reversed if the baseline was
        oriented west to east.  This is now fixed.  The phase of the
        phase cal is now adjusted for any offsets in delay.  This
        problem was causing the phase cals on the "remote" stations to
        be trashed.  Also the max and min. peculiar delay offsets are
        kept on a baseline basis.
            The delay residual in the output data was wrong by an amount
        corresponding to one delay lag.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5616.  February 9, 1990      APLGEN:ZDHPRL.FOR              Bill C
        The use of the intrinsic function "REAL" to convert from a 32
        bit integer to double precision was replaced by "DFLOAT".  Use
        of "REAL" was causing a signifigant precision loss in
        translating HP double precision words on Convexes;  DFLOAT

 5617.  February 10, 1990    CLCOR.FOR, CLCOR.HLP           Bill C.
        Added two new options: 'PCAL' to insert MkIII manual phase cals
        and 'SBDL' to add corrections to the residual delays without
        modifying the total model delays.  These two options are needed
        for procesion MkIII VLBI data.
           Also changed the adverb BPARM to CLPARM which is dimensioned
        20.  Also CLPARM.HLP.

 5618.  February 10, 1990      POPSDAT.HLP, RUNSYS:NEWPARM.001  Bill C
        Added the new, task specific adverb CLPARM.  In POPSDAT.HLP this
        was done in a procedure ant the end of the file rather than
        defining an adverb that POPS knows by name; i.e. DAPL.INC
        doesn't need to be changed and AIPS etc recompiled and linked.
        This change required that POPSGN be run by hand on each NRAO
        computer updated by the midnight job.

 5619.  February 13, 1990       ZFRE2.C in APLSUN              Chris
        Modified version of the generic Unix ZFRE2. Modifications are
        necessary for Sun OS since the Sun implementation of {\tt df}
        returns the information for the requested disks in the order in
        which they occur in {\tt /etc/fstab} irrespective of the order
        in which they were specified on the command line.

 5620.  February 15, 1990          SDTUV                     Bill C.
        Removed restriction that the input data files have 14 data
        columns.  Also fixed a couple of places where zero divides were
        possible.  Also added the Parkes 64 m antenna to the list of
        antennas that it knows about.

 5622.  February 15, 1990          CALIB                    Bill C
        Fixed problem with averaging all data in each IF.  This problem
        only occured when fringe fitting MkIII data.  Also put the SN
        table writing stuff in GASOLV into a separate routine.

 5623.  February 15, 1990       CLCOR.FOR, CLCOR.HLP       Bill C.
        Modified 'SBDL' option to modify the phase as well as the delay.
        The phase is assumed to be at the reference frequency if the
        delay residual correction is non zero.  DATCAL corrects to the
        frequencies of the actual data.  Also updated the table of
        sunspot numbers in the CLCOR.HLP file.

 5624.  February 15, 1990       APLNOT:CGASET.FOR          Bill C.
        Removed the phase corrections for channel selection with non
        zero delay corrections.  This correction was also being done in
        DATCAL and was redundant in CGASET.

 5626.  February 16, 1990            TABHDR              Bill C.
        Fixed logic error which caused the length of character table
        entries read from ASCII FITS tables to always be 1.  This
        appears to have had no effect on calibration tables but was
        discovered at CfA.  This affected UVLOD and IMLOD.

 5629.  February 19,1990        UVCOP                  Bill C.
        Fixed precision problem in computing subarray number.  Also the
        5 day time correction removal when BPARM(2)>0 is only done for

 5630.  February 19, 1990      UVFIX                   Bill C.
        Corrected a number of errors in the handling of compressed data;
        the output for compressed data was trashed.  Also fixed a bug by
        which the subarray information was stripped off the
        baseline/subarray code.  Also fixed to loop over subarrays if no
        subarray is requested.  Added a SAVE statment in UVWCAL for the
        values that were computed on the first call.  Also changed
        UVFIX.HLP.

 5631.  February 19, 1990      HORUS                    Bill C.
        The specified subarray was being ignored.  This caused HORUS to

        messed up calibration of VLA like data.  The RCP and LCP data
        were added and called RCP and there were no solutions for LCP
        data.  Also fixed bug which caused the mean gain modulus

 5635.  February 20, 1990        ZFRE2 in APLSUN            Chris
        ZFRE2 expected the first part of the pathname of an AIPS
        ``disk'' to be the mount point of the device on which the
        logical disk resided. This precondition was not met if any
        of the AIPS logicals DA01 etc. referred to a symbolic link.
        This version of ZFRE2 now interrogates each file referred
        to by the AIPS disk logicals to see if it is a symbolic link
        and, if so, reads the value of the link.

 5636.  February 21, 1990     TKLAB                       Bill C.
        Fixed bad call to NAMEST.  It was being passes a Hollerith
        name/class rather than a character string. This caused an
        infinite loop (on Suns at least) in verb TKSLICE.

        Fixed bug left over from the overhaul.  A numeric array was
        being passed to ZPHFIL and ZOPEN for the file name rather than a
        character.  This caused failure of the open (on Unix at least -
        this may work on Vaxes).  Also cleaned up some other junk not

        The GAST at UT=0 was being written into the AN table as radians
        rather than degrees. Also the formula used to calculate IAT-UTC
        was getting progressively wrong as time went on, so I inserted
        the look up table stolen from Starlink . This is correct up to
        Jan 1 1990 - we will need to think about how we cope with this
        - maybe a table distributed by AIPSSERV and let VLBIN read the
        table?

        them into the output vector.  (Radius is not used and need

        Changed DTVF.INC and DSPF.INC to add a variable retaining the
        source random parameter.  Changed GRIDTB and GRIDTC to get
        the correct source ID number even when the user has specified
        a single source.  Changed SPFLG and TVFLG to check frequency
        and source ID numbers when making the list of times to be
        gridded.  Also changed them to correct the handling of the
        interactive (graphical) window setting and to remember the
        input source random parameter offset.  Dropped unused FORMATs.
        Corrected channel number displayed in SPFLG's interactive
        modes.  It used a correct channel number, but displayed a bad
        one if the reference channel was not the first channel.

        Cleaned up the code a bit.  Also changed the formulas used for
        the SIN and ARC projections.  They failed when the angles got
        very large so that ASIN became ambiguous.  Now both use ATAN2.

 5646.  February 28, 1990??       TVFLG, SPFLG                 Eric
        Corrected GRIDTB --- it was regarding an end-of-file condition
        as unacceptable at the location where the first point of each
        group was read.  At one time, this location was for the first
        visiblity, but that was changed some time ago to do things in
        groups for vectorization.  Corrected SPFLG and TVFLG --- in the
        first read through the data to determine the list of times, the
        tests on subarray, source, and FQ number were branching all the
        way to the end of the loop.  Thereby, the index was not
        incremented and the same point was retested and re-rejected
        for the full buffer's worth.  This could make the list of times
        seriously incomplete or in error in some cases.

 5647.  February 28, 1990                FILLM            Phil/Bill J.
        Migrated the fixes inserted in TST 2 weeks ago, nobody
        screamed so everything appears to be OK.
        Several bugs were fixed, one outstanding one and others
        (re)introduced recently.
        (1) The problem with the integration just prior to midnight
            being labelled wrongly was finally found and fixed, the
            fact that midnight has occurred is now caught and dealt
            with in MCSUM.
        (2) When antennas enter the array during an experiment the
            order of the baselines in the data arrays changes, this
            was not being trapped. MCWANT now checks to see if the
            number of antennas and/or the order of antennas has
            changed and if so it forces a call to MCINI. I fixed this
            18 months ago but my fix had been removed even though
            the variables and arrays I used were still declared.
        (3) An associated problem is that the AN table is written when
            a file is first opened so it only contains information
            for antennas present at the beginning of the observing run.
            A new subroutine (ANTUPD) now updates the AN table before
            the file is closed.
        (4) The bandwidth being written to the SU table was the full
            bandwidth rather than the channel width.
        (5) There was a problem occurring when the number of channels
            changed during the run, this change was not always caught.
            Added another section to MCWANT to explicitly check for
            this change and also for a change in correlator mode.
            When these change the program is now forced to determine
            if a new file must be opened.
        (6) The annoying (to the users) feature of having to specify
            integration time + 0.2 sec to obtain a specified int.
            time has been disabled. This will need more checking to
            determine if it really works.

 5648.  March 1, 1990              KEYCOP                   Bill C

        Fixed several problems with OPTYPE='SUM'.  The 2 IF mode
        (BIF=0) was disabled in the inputs checking and BIF=2 or higher
        actually did IF=1 due to indexing errors.

 5651.  March 9, 1990       UVPLT               Meil Killeen/Bill C
        When DOCAL=1, UVPLT looked for an SN table rather than CL table
        for multi-source data bases.  It now does not check if the file
        is a multi-source file to see if an SN table exists.

 5652.  March 9, 1990        KNTR.FOR, KNTR.HLP  Marl Calabretta/Bill C
        Fixed a couple of bugs in KNTR, one relating to annotation
        of the contour levels, and another in computing the maximum
        absolute pixel value in KONDRW.
           Also changed the way that blanked pixels are handled.  It used
        to be based on connecting pixel centres, but this could produce
        stick-like "contours" for small irregularly shaped clusters of
        pixels surrounded by blank areas.  The algorithm now delineates
        the pixel edges.  There are pros and cons for either method but
        the latter is less likely to confuse users.
           Also expanded the explain part of the help file slightly.

 5654.  March 12, 1990    ZVTVX2 and ZVTVX3 in APLBERK      Chris
        ZVTVX2 and ZVTVX3 were, incorrectly, treating the case where a
        read from a {\tt SOCK_STREAM} returned less bytes than were
        requested as an error. This was causing TV-by-wire to fail over
        long distances (AOC to Charlottesville). Both routines now loop
        to read the outstanding bytes until either the complete packet
        is received or a genuine error or end-of-file is detected. Write
        operations are treated in the same manner, although partial
        writes are extremely unlikely in the absence of errors.

        program is FILIA2 (open logical unit 6 via ZMSGOP) or FILAIP (open
        logical unit 5 via ZOPEN).  Otherwise, non-VMS installations fail.
        Also if FILAI2 or FILAIP, don't get device characteristics common
        from disk or make accounting entry.  Otherwise, disconcerting error
        messages are issued when the AC and/or SP files and/or the MS file
        for user #1 don't yet exist (FILAI2 and FILAIP create these as part

 5862.  March 15, 1990        UVMDIV                      Phil
        The call sequence to CHNCOP in UVMDIV on CVAX was wrong, it
        was OK on nrao1 - God knows what was on the other machines.
        Luckily that piece of code is not used that often.
        Moved from 15JUL90 this date.

 5863.  March 15, 1990        QVEX:QPUT, QGET, QPHSRO     Glen
        Removed CVEX QPUT and QGET which were identical to the
        QPSAP versions.  QPHSRO in PSAP uses double precision.
        Removed this date, consistent with 15JUL90.

 5864.  March 15, 1990        FILLM                       Gareth/Bill C
        Fixed numerous bugs which occured when a scan contained a single
        averaging interval and the next scan was to go into another file.
        The control logic was getting hopelessly confused.  Errors in the
        handling of changes in the number or order of antennas was
        complicating the issue.  In this latter case, tests were made using
        values set in MCANT or MCH1 which had not been called yet.  Several
        of these (number of antennas, correlator mode) are now decoded in
        MCWANT.  All of the changes associated with these problems were in
        MCWANT.
           Corrected an indexing problem in MCGBRC which caused and
        occasional spectrum to be corrupted and an infinite loop under
        special conditions.  The logic error was fixed and a trap was made
        for the infinite loop although it should not occur if the routine
        is working correctly.  The last baseline in a CDA will be lost if
        this trap is invoked.  Fixed addressing bug for mode 2BC.
        Inserted correct source and FQ id numbers into the first
        visibility record of each scan; formerly the source id and FQ id
        from the previous scan were being used.
           Modified to accept autocorrelations for revisions 24 and later.
        Modified to only put data with the same correlator mode in the same
        file.  This involves writing a header keyword giving the correlator
        mode in each line data file.
           Changed the error handling process to return continuous EOF
        conditions from MCREAD if more than PELIM (currently 50) parity
        errors have previously occurred.
           The current file(s) being written are now expanded in size by
        10,000 visibility records when they are opened, and compressed when
        they are closed.  This minimizes the disk space required when FILLM
        is running, but could lead to disk fragmentation if the observation
        forces multiple openings and closings.  FILLM used to compress all
        files that it had appended to when it exited successfully; less
        fragmentation, but potentially an unnecessary disk hog on abnormal
        termination(s).

 5865.  March, 19 1990           MK3IN                  Bill C
        The source number written into the CL table was always the first
        source in the source list.  Also added call a call to initialize
        the A tape header info when the end of a scan was reached.  Put
        a trap into AT20XX to ignore a scan if the cross reference table
        overflowed.  This should not happen under normal circumstances
        but bad (?) type 20?? records can cause this to happen.
        Moved from 15OCT90 and 15JUL90 this date.

 5866.  March.  March 19, 1990    GETHUT                      Bill C
        Added calls to SPFIL to make sure nulls were removed from TABLE
        info.  This was causing FITTP to write nulls in tables headers.
        Moved from 15OCT90 and 15JUL90 this date

 5867.  March 19, 1990      FITTP                     Bill C.
        Corrected indexing error reading history file.  This was adding
        an extra 8 blanks after the "HISTORY" on the FITS history cards
        and cause then to occasionally run onto the next card.
        Moved from 15OCT90 and 15JUL90 this date

 5868.  March 28, 1990      FILLM                     Gareth
        Corrected bug recently introduced in reading the parameters
        from an existing catalog entry (this is for the case when FILLM
        will try to append to an existing file.)  Corrected the error
        handling when a logical record is incomplete at the end of
        tape.  Fixed the NX record count when closing a dataset.

 5870.  April 8, 1990           $APLGEN/ZLWIO.FOR                       Kerry
                                $APLGEN/ZLWOP.FOR
        Switched to FORMAT'ed OPEN and WRITEs.  Also corrected call sequence
        to ZLASCL in ZLWIO (error return missing).
        Moved from 15JUL90/15OCT90 this date.

 5871.  April 8, 1990           $APGNOT/LWPLA.FOR                       Kerry
        Fixed buffering problem and errors introduced by changing from
        hollerith to CHARACTER constructs during the overhaul.  Eliminated
        EOT character from the beginning of the output PostScript program
        which causes problems on some laser printers and does not seem to
        be necessary.  Eliminated inappropriate H2CHR call and replaced it
        with simple CHARACTER substring assignment.  Also switched character
        font from Courier to Helvetica-Bold.  Tested CNTR and GREYS plots
        using the VLBA correlator group's QMS PS810 and at non-NRAO sites
        using Apple Laserwriter and NEC LC890 laser printers.
        Moved from 15JUL90/15OCT90 this date.

 5872.  April 8, 1990           $SYSUNIX/ZLASCL.PS                      Kerry
        Created a special version of the ZLASCL script for use with PostScript
        laser printers that prefixes "%!PS-Adobe-" followed by "%%Creator:AIPS
        task LWPLA" to the LWPLA output.  The first needs to appear at the
        beginning of the output ("%!... distinguishes PostScript programs from
        simple text) on a line by itself and this is not possible with the
        buffering scheme used in LWPLA.  ZLASCL.PS should be substituted for
        ZLASCL at sites with PostScript engines.  Some laser printers (e.g.,
        NEC LC890) may also require that the LWPLA output be processed to
        limit the number of characters per line to, say 132 (e.g., using "fmt
        -s -132").
        Moved from 15JUL90/15OCT90 this date.

                                $APLBERK/ZABORS.C
                                $APLSUN/ZABORS.C
        Eliminated "core" file preservation mechanism entirely.  Also changed
        to commit suicide with a self-inflicted illegal instruction rather than
        by calling "abort" which issues different signals on different systems.
        Changed in 15JUL90 and 15OCT90 same date.

 5874.  April 8, 1990           $APLSUN/ZABOR2.C                        Kerry
        A new module that differs from the $APLBERK version in that it calls
        "ieee_handler" to "set" the action for IEEE "common" floating_point
        exceptions to SIGFPE_ABORT.  Otherwise, invalid floating-point results
        (i.e., NaNs) go undetected.  Should abort now.
        Changed in 15JUL90 and 15OCT90 same date.

 5875.  April 8, 1990           $APLBELL/ZCREA2.C                       Kerry
                                $APLBELL/ZACTV9.C
        New modules.  The $APLBELL version of ZCREA2.C differs from the generic
        UNIX version in terms of header files.  The $APLBELL version of
        ZACTV9.C differs from the generic version in that it calls "fork"
        instead of "vfork" (a Berkeley UNIXism).
        Changed in 15JUL90 and 15OCT90 same date.

        the current directory, $SYSLOCAL and $SYSUNIX before all others to
        avoid command name conflicts (e.g., CC the AIPS C compilation script
        versus CC the C++ translator commonly installed as a local system
        utility).  This is where "local" area logicals should be defined now
        (i.e., instead of $SYSLOCAL versions of AREAS.CSH and AREAS.SH).
        Changed in 15JUL90 and 15OCT90 same date.

        Changed execution search path definition to search the current working
        directory, $SYSLOCAL and $SYSUNIX before all others to avoid command
        name conflicts (e.g., CC).  Also changed definitions of $CDOLD, $CDNEW
        and $CDTST to use CDVER.CSH and CDVER.SH from $SYSLOCAL (formerly they
