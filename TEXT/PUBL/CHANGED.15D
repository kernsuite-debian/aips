14498.  December 2, 2014         Version update               Eric
        Changed $APLSUB/GETRLS.FOR. $INSUNIX/INSTEP1,
        $SYSPERL/install.pl, $SYSPERL/update.pl, $SYSPERL/ZXHLP2.PL,
        $SYSPERL/LaCook.PL, $UPDUNIX/UPDCONTROL,
        $SYSUNIX/AIPSPATH.CSH, $SYSUNIX/AIPSPATH.SH
        to make 31DEC15 instead of 31DEC14 - also fix dates in
        install.pl.
        Moved nowhere.

14499.  December 4, 2014        SAD, TVSAD                Eric
        Changed:
        SAD:     Subtract Gaussian over wider area, TVSAD suggested
                 that the previous setting really did not go far
                 enough.
        TVSAD:   1. Add CURVALUE option to both menus.
                 2. Have CURVALUE run when setting the Gaussian
                 parameters.
                 3. Allow up to 8 (parameterized) Gaussians in any one
                 island (only under user command).
        Also TVSAD and HLPTVSAD help files edited.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14500.  December 6, 2014            TVSAD                 Eric
        Corrected the menu placement which should not expand if the
        character size expands (and it was too far in in any case).
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14501.  December 11, 2014          Misc               Eric
        Changed
        1. KWIKHD to understand XX/YY polarization
        2. SAD to subtract components over a much wider range of rows
        3. TVSAD as SAD
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14502.  December 11, 2014        AIPS Memo 119        Eric
        AIPS Memo 119, describing the use of the new TVSAD task, has
        been put in $AIPSPUBL in PS (very large), PS.gz, and PDF
        forms.
        $AIPSPUBL is in all releases.

14503.  December 11, 2014             UVSUB              Eric
        removed simple prohibition to allow XX/YY to be modeled with I
        models.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14504.  December 11, 2014             CENTFQ             Eric
        Changed this subroutine, called by numerous tasks, to
        adjust the FQ table for centering the frequency reference
        channel.  The routine did not consider that the column numbers
        and pointers might differ from the input to the output files.
        But if an old FQ with no bandcode comes in a new one with
        blank bandcode will go out.  So sepearte numbers/pointers for
        the two files are required.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14505.  December 12, 2014           UVSUB               Eric
        The desire to divide the RL and LR correlations by the I model
        leads to the addition of OPCODE 'DIV4' to UVSUB and its help.
        Also change:
        DGDS.INC  Add logical DOALL4
        GETCTL    Now can have 4 factors and set NSTOK to 4 if DOALL4
                  is true and the model is IPOL.
        ALGMEM    FACT2 now dimensioned 4 and all 4 need scaling
        ALGSTB    FACT2 now dimensioned 4 and all 4 need scaling
        VISDFT    FACT2 now dimension 4, scale all 4, in one mode set
                  all 4 based on DOALL4, reorder writing to AP memory
                  since subtract will never have DOALL4 true and
                  divide does not care about "keep data"
        VSCDFT    Dimension FACT2 as 4 since calls GETCTL
        VSFDFT    Dimension FACT2 as 4 since calls GETCTL
        UVCON     Dimension FACT2 as 4 and reorder loading of AP
                  memory
        EVAUV     Dimension FACT2 as 4 and reorder loading of AP
                  memory
        UVSUB     Recognize DIV4 as both DIVIDE and DOALL4 true.
        UVSUB     Help: add OPCODE 'DIV4'
        Moved nowhere.

14506.  December 12, 2014             CLIP              Eric
        The type of clip level to use for V was compromised by a typo.
        Should work now.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14507.  December 15, 2014            HUINT               Eric
        Add remarks about HUINT to help files for TVHUI and TVHUEINT.
        Also corrected typo in AIPS Memo 119.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14508.  December 15, 2014        INPUTS                 Eric
        Setting the page full suppression at DOPRINT=-2 hits too many
        other uses - so changed it to <= -9.  Changed AU1A and help
        files for INPUTS and INP.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14509.  December 18, 2014           CORFQ                Eric
        Changed it so that FACTOR < 0 causes the uvw to be scaled but
        not the header and antenna-table header frequencies.  This can
        be used to undo the unfortunate re-scaling of holography
        "u,v,w"'s in almost all AIPS tasks.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14510.  December 18, 2014           UVHOL                Eric
        Added adverb DPARM to specify the max weight, amplitude, and
        u,v for the display.  The self-scale routine remains present
        if DPARM(1) < 0 but is skipped unless requested.  Corrected
        the display of channel and frequency to use the correct
        average channel and frequency computed with the average
        channel and BIF.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14511.  December 23, 2014             TVHLD                Eric
        NEW TASK: The old tasks TVHXF and TVHLD have been removed.
        They depended on hardware functions of the IIS Model 70 (and
        perhaps 75) which are not available in XAS and other TV
        devices.  The new task, written in modern AIPS style, attempts
        to offer greater functionality than the old TVHLD.  It loads
        the TV with a "histogram equalized" version of the input
        image.  An interactive menu allows you to control the PIXRANGE
        used in the equalization and select various functions to be
        performed on the normal histogram before it is used to do the
        equalization.  Some of these functions enhance the higher
        levels of the image relative to the lower levels more than
        others.  The usual image display/enhancement options are also
        offered.  When done, you may write out the equalized image or
        you may exit without writing an image.  Also created new help
        files TVHLD and HLPTVHLD (real-time help for menu).
        Moved nowhere.

14512.  December 26, 2014        AIPSLetter             Eric
        Put back LET14B.{TEX,PS,PDF} in $AIPSPUBL.
        Moved to all versions automatically.

14513.  December 30, 2014         SNPLT                Eric
        Test on outside plot range not on correct plot types (tested
        REAL) and type 24, not the PC phase.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14514.  December 30, 2014           SNFIT              Eric
        NEW TASK: Drift (or driven) scans through a source can produce
        in the SN-table gains a plot of the primary beam.  Made a
        version of SNPLT that can fit a 2nd or 4th order polynomial to
        such gains, solving for the time at the peak, the width, and
        the function.
        Moved nowhere.

14515.  Decmber 30, 2014       EVLA.ant.2014             Eric
        Copied the on-line EVLA antenna position correction file for
        2014 to $AIPSTARS and created a new 2015 on-line file for use
        for new antenna location corrections.
        Moved to all versions automatically.

14516.  January 2, 2015             DOFARS                Eric
        Changed the help file to emphasize things about BLC and TRC.
        Values 1,2,4,5,6,7 are applied in TRANS, BLC(3), TRC(3) are
        applied in the FARS step.  Dropped OUT2NAME et al from inputs
        and help and DOFARS.001 - they were left over from earlier
        versions of FARS.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14517.  January 8, 2015          DOFARS                 Eric
        I messed up the proc (close quotes issue).
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14518.  January 13, 2015        RMFIT                    Eric
        Task needs to copy FQ table (if any) to output residual images
        but not the model fit images.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14519.  January 13, 2015         VLBAUTIL/VLBATECR         Amy
        When VLBATECR calculated which files it needed to download it did not
        handle observations that went over the new year correctly.  Fixed.
        Moved to 31DEC14 Jan 19.

14520.  January 15, 2015          HOLOG                 Eric/Rick
        NEW TASK (sort of)  - a simplified version of HOLGR which i
        will leave alone.  Rick Perley developed the simplifications
        and I have worked over the code.  The most significant changes
        were to make it play well with the UVHOL and PANEL program
        that precede and follow the HOLGR step.  The DFT routine was
        changed to use double precision internally which changed its
        answers at the 1 part in 1000-10000 level.
        Moved nowhere.

14521.  January 15, 2015            PANEL               Eric/Rick
        NEW TASK: Rick's panel.f developed initially by Mkie Kestevan
        was converted into an AIPS task.  The pgplot plots were
        replaced with AIPS plots.  The code was restructured to
        suitable subroutines.  The unformatted file inputs were
        replaced with reading the AIPS images from the AIPS files
        directly and reading text files for the panel layout (if not
        EVLA which is available without a text file).  Blanking under
        the feed legs and subreflector is now handled with a blanking
        image (the V_AMP image from HOLOG).  The task gets some of the
        parameter values (e.g. frequency, mapsize, # pointings) from
        the input image header and offers controls over which plots
        are desired and allows suppresion of portions of the plots
        (grey scale, contours, panel layout).  The fitting routine was
        enhanced to take the masking into account and to avoid
        singular matrices when a panel is fully masked.
        Moved nowhere.

14522.  January 16, 2015            VLBARUN               Amy
        Fixed two small gotchas in VLBARUN.  If a user starts aips
        with "notv" then then default TVCHAN=1 is invalid, this caused
        KNTR to die which then caused VLBARUN to die; changed TVCHAN=0.
        Second if the command "convert" does not exist on system and
        OUTFILE is set (i.e., the user wants output plots in a html file)
        VLBARUN would run, but no plots would be produced and the html
        file would be useless.  Changed VLBARUN to check if OUTFILE was
        set that "convert" exists, and not to run if it does not.  Also
        undated HLP file to say that "convert" is required for those
        features.
        Moved to 31DEC14 Jan 19.

14523.  January 16, 2015            FTFLG                 Eric
        Some vestiges of the way SPFLG handles baselines remained in
        the code and they were not correct for FTFLG.  It led the
        output flag table to be incorrect when one or all baselines to
        one antenna were specified in the ANTENNAS and BASELINE
        adverb.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14524.  January 19, 2015          HOLGR                 Eric
        Changed Fortran to do the DFT in double precision, to put out
        a FREQ axis in the output images, to output a keyword for use
        by PANEL, and to read the frequency from the input file.
        Moved nowhere.

14525.  January 20, 2015          BPASS                   Eric
        One array was dimensioned 500 and should have been MXBASE.
        ALMA with 36 antennas breaks this badly.  The history routine
        listing antennas also had a typo bug and was not general and
        so failed in this case.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14526.  January 21, 2015               IMAGR              Eric
        Changed:
        IMAGR    When DOTV is true at the beginning, DOWAIT is now
                 assumed.  If OBOXFILE is blank at the beginning, a
                 temporary OBOXFILE='HOME:OBOXtempYYYYMMDD.HHMMSS'
                 is created and used.  If the final OBOXFILE is this
                 file, then it will be deleted inthe history routine
                 at the end.
        QCLEAN   In CLNTV, when TVBOX would delete a boxes, ask for
                 permission.  If not YES or yes, do REBOX instead.
                 In CLNTEL, trap a change in OBOXFILE and handle it
                 properly, copying the old one to the new name and, if
                 the old one is the temp file, deleting it.  The
                 expansion with date and time is allowed in the TELL
                 function too.
        IMAGR    help file - add info on OBOXFILE and TVBOX.
        OBOXFILE Help file - added comments about IMAGR options.
        Moved nowhere.

14527.  January 22, 2015              TVHLD               Eric
        The writing of the top label did not take the actual window
        into account properly.  Its position must pay attention to the
        window and since they change, the graphics plane needs to be
        zeroed in advance.  Changed to have a subroutine write the top
        label line and to call that routine in the load function
        (where it was before) and also ahead of the menu function.
        This should trap many of the window size/shape changes
        promptly.  Discovered a buffer used for OFM that was only 8192
        words, just 1/4 of the required size.  Changed TVSAD to make
        its comparable buffer be equivalenced to adequate buffers.
        Moved nowhere.

14528.  January 26, 2015        INPUTS                 Eric
        Setting the page full suppression at DOPRINT=-2 hits too many
        other uses - so changed it to <= -9.  Changed AU1A and help
        files for INPUTS and INP.  Somehow this did not get into
        31DEC15 (except CHANGE.DOC) but it is in 31DEC14.
        Moved to 31DEC14 15 DECEMBER.

14529.  January 26, 2015        INPUTS, GO             Eric
        Changed AU1A and AU2 to let the inputs section of the help
        file set the lower limit of "system" adverbs (disk, tape, TV,
        etc).  In this way, tasks, varbs and procedure that require
        INDISK > 0 can enforce it.
        Moved nowhere.

14530.  January 26, 2015           DOFARS              Eric
        DOFARS does not use OUTCLASS so remove it from the help and
        run files.  It does require INDISK > 0 and IN2DISK > 0, so put
        that requirement in the procedure and in the inputs and help
        for DOFARS.
        Moved nowhere.

14531.  January 26, 2015           SCIMG, SCMAP            Eric
        Changed SCIMG and SCMAP to support TV image labeling, more
        general OBOXFILE usage (see IMAGR) including stars and
        changing with TELL, and correcting the setting of the output
        UV data sort order.  Required changing QCLEAN so that the
        name of the internal WRIBOX does not conflict with the $APLSUB
        version used by these tasks (no UN-boxes).  Changed the
        self-call TVBOX command to request permission to delete
        pre-existing boxes and both to allow interactive text input in
        the Clean section.
        Moved nowhere.

14532.  January 27, 2015            REFREQ               Eric
        Removed this dangerous RUN file and its help.  It changed the
        offsets in the FQ table so that the first IF offset was not
        zero so that it could move the frequency reference pixel
        without have to copy and change the u,v,w values.  There are
        places in AIPS where this would lead to bad values of u,v,w
        being used since not all tasks read the details of the FQ
        table.  Task CENTR and adverb FQCENTER in many other tasks
        deals with this problem correctly.
        Moved nowhere.

14533.  January 29, 2015            MORIF               Eric
        Added option to combine IFs as well as subdivide them.
        There was a bug in the handling of BP-like tables that made a
        mess of the results.
        Moved bug fix to 31DEC14 this date.

14534.  February 3, 2015             NOIFS              Eric
        The SY tables were copied with all IFs.  They need to be
        selected properly.
        Moved nowhere.

14535.  February 3, 2015            TVHLD               Eric
        TVHLD did not put the depth in the image catalog header,
        meaning TVWINDOWs off of the image were bad.  It also used the
        number of pixels in the working image as the number in the
        full image, causing it to fail when BLC and/or TRC were
        specified.
        Moved nowhere.

14536.  February 4, 2015            UVFRE              Eric
        NEW TASK: An HGEOM for frequencies in UV data sets.  Regrids
        the data of one data set onto the frequency structure of
        another (as best it can).  Updated INTPARM help file which was
        all wrong for current usage.
        Moved nowhere.

14537.  February 5, 2015     consecutive seq numbers        Eric
        Changed
        1. MCUBE help file to point out that some of the sequence
        numbers from INSEQ through IN2SEQ are allowed to be missing.
        2. FQUBE Fortran and help to allow the same.
        3. STUFFR RUN file and help to allow missing ones.  This was
        rather tricky due to all the intermediate files that get
        created and then destroyed.  Verbs NAMEGET and CHKNAME were
        essential in this.
        Moved nowhere.

14538.  February 10, 2015           UVPLT                 Eric
        Changed the print out of the binned values to include the
        number of samples going into each bin.
        Moved nowhere.

14539.  February 10, 2015         BPASS help             Eric
        Add phrasing to point out that division by a model is turned
        off when channel 0 division is done.
        Moved nowhere.

14540.  February 11, 2015           TYSMO                 Eric
        The clip parameters (APARMs) were not applied unless the MWF
        cutoff parameters (CPARM(6-9)) were set.  Corrected this to
        apply the APARMs with or without the CPARMs.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14541.  February 11, 2015            FRING                Eric
        ALMA produces data with one IF having negative frequency
        increment and the other with positiv frequency increment.
        FRING required a couple more absolute value calls in handling
        this.
        Moved nowhere.

14542.  February 12, 2015          UVCON                Eric
        The inputs section stated that APARM(10) = 0 would become 1
        and allow no blockage at all.  In fact, the help said the
        truth, in which 1 means a fully blocked aperture is allowed.
        Moved nowhere.

14543.  February 16, 2015      table format updates        Eric
        The failure to update table formats is not a disaster for some
        of the updates (AN, SU, FG, BL, BP) but is for SN and CL.
        Read only file systems are more likely to have old formats and
        cannot be updated, so changed
        ANTINI    to not die on ANREFM error, updated message
        SOUINI    to not die on SUREFM error, updated message
        TABSOU    to check that RAOBS and DECOBS have a valid column
        BPASET    to issue message but not die on BPREFM error
        GAININ    to issue message but not die on BLREFM error, will
                  die on SNREFM, CLREFM errors
        TABBL     to check the FREQID has a valid column
        Moved nowhere.

14544.  February 17, 2015            UVFIT                Eric
        Added messages about whether it converges or not and did an
        extra JTRIM on the two text file names (some ZTXOPN issues
        were reported).
        Moved nowhere.

14545.  February 18, 2015           VLOG                   Amy
        VLOG has frequency ranges hardwired, I widened then to the
        maximum allowed by VLBA recievers.  I also added 3mm to the
        set of frequencies.
        Moved nowhere.

14546.  February 18, 2015          XAS                   Eric
        Character writing into grey-scale memories used a background
        of 1 which means that the characters could disappear with some
        LUTs.  Changed it to zero in XAS and in $YGEN/YCHRW.
        Moved nowhere.

14547.  February 19, 2015           POPS                 Eric
        On occasion for no known reason, LTSTOR returns a pointer to a
        data area already used.  This seems to happen when
        concatenation is being done.  Changed CONCAT to drop the
        saving of the string data to memory which has already been
        done by the call to LTSTOR anyway.  It was that saving that
        was causing the failures.
        Moved nowhere.

14548.  February 19, 2015       TVMOVIE, TVCUBE           Eric
        Added the adverb DOALL to these verbs to have it loop over all
        planes on the data "cube".  DOALL false loops only over the
        first axis (> 2) with more than one pixel.  Labeling in DOALL
        true (when there are more axes > 2 with > 1 pixel) is a simple
        plane number.  Changed both help files and AU5D.
        Moved nowhere.

14549.  February 19, 2015        UVIMG                Eric
        UVIMG has been re-written to make images with any axes, not
        just those of the UV data set sort order.  It can also make an
        image of the count in each pixel.  The images may be done with
        a count of 1 in the nearest pixel, or the standard
        interpolation functions may be used over a range of pixels
        around each sample.  NCHAV spectral channels may be gridded
        into each plane, planes are separated by CHINC spectral
        channels, and there may be multiple IFs, producing a
        4-dimensional "cube" (hence the above TVMOVIE change).  The
        image of data parameters may be an interpolated image or a
        convolved image.
        Moved nowhere.

14550.  February 21, 2015         bandpass              Eric
        The low level, VLB routine DETRAT was still in left-hand
        antenna coordinates.  This was known to the bandpass
        application routine BPASET but not elsewhere, particularly
        BPASS.  Therefore BPASS made solutions which were not good
        when applied to the calibration data at least for
        high-frequency, narrow-channel data.  Changed DETRAT to be
        right handed and BPASET to go along with this.  Changed some
        vestigial bits in BPASS that had no effect.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14551.  February 21, 2015         GC tables               Eric
        Changed PGCV.INC to reduce the excessive allowance of entries
        per row of tabulated gains from 200 to 120 and to correct the
        buffer size which was a factor of 2 too small (did not allow
        for 2 polarizations I guess).
        Changed ANTAB to read the KEYIN file twice, the first time to
        determine the type of GAIN entries and their size and the
        second to build the TY, GC, et al. tables.
        Moved nowhere.

14552.  February 23, 2015              PANEL              Eric
        Rick gave me the wrong values for the VLA panel radii.
        He has now "corrected" them (I hope).
        Moved nowhere.

14553.  February 23, 2015             TVHLD               Eric
        The output routine build the output header including the
        increments which were supposed to apply only to the display.
        Fixed it to use 1.0.
        Moved nowhere.

14554.  February 25, 2015             SNSMO               Eric
        The VLMB mode uses the average of the phases over all IFs
        after they have had the phase due to delay removed.  They
        should all be the same at that point, but what is removed is
        the smoothed multi-band delay, not the unsmoothed one which
        created the phases to begin with.  So they are not the same
        and the relative phasing between IFs can be damaged.  This is
        especially so since PHASES are what the task smoothed (after
        trying to avoid phase wraps).  So Changed
        SNSMO  help file to add info in the inputs for choices of
               SAMPTYPE and SMOTYPE.  Added statement that BIF/EIF are
               ignored in VLMB and the new VLDE mode.  And added a
               VLDE mode with lengthy descriptions of it and an
               improved description of VLMB.
        SNSMO  Fortran file to set BIF/EIF to the full range in VLMB
               and VLDE modes.  Changed to set NPIECE=NUMIF except for
               VLMB and VLDE.  Changed call to smooth amp/phase to
               loop from BIF to EIF by NPIF where NPIF is number of
               IFs in the group (# groups or pieces = max of 1 and
               FRING's APARM(5)-1).  The smooth amp/phase now uses
               multi-band or single-band delay depending on SMOTYPE to
               correct the phase using all IFs (VLMB) or only the
               first valid IF in the IF range (VLDE) before smoothing.
               After smoothing, it applies the smoothed phase plus an
               appropriate delay correction to each IF in the group.
               It now smooths real and imaginary separately and
               computes phases from there.

14555.  February 25, 2015            IMAGR                Eric
        QCLEAN turned of interaction "ok" when OVERLAP < 2, perhaps
        once for good reason, but no longer.  Leave that flag as the
        main programs set it.
        Moved nowhere (31DEC15 bug only).

14556.  February 27, 2015           DOVLAMP                  Amy
        Procedure to produce amplitude calibration for phased-VLA
        data used in VLBI.  The procedure uses VLAMP and opptionally
        CALIB (if flux calibrator is present) to produce an ANTAB
        style file that can be loaded with ANTAB.  The procedure
        attempts to be as automated as possible.
        Moved nowhere.

14557.  February 27, 2015    TVLAYOUT, KNTR, GREYS       Eric
        Made holography panel layout plots more widely available.
        Changed GREYS Fortran and help to allow INFILE='VLA' or 'VLBA'
        to mean use standard values of the layout rather than require
        text files.  Added INFILE option to KNTR Fortran and help to
        plot layouts on each panel of a single or multi-panel plot
        like GREYS (so can also do "bolts").  Changed POPSDAT.HLP,
        NEWPARMS.001, AU5B, and made a new help file and new Fortran
        routine LAYOUT to create verb TVLAYOUT which overlays a layout
        plot on a TV image.
        Moved nowhere.

14558.  February 28, 2015       Obit things             Eric
        Discovered bad usage in many ZDCHI2.FOR versions.  Fixed
        LINUX, LNX64, MACPPC and LINUXPPC versions to have
        SYSTYP='UNIX' and SYSVER=$ARCH.
        Changed $AIPSUB/AUO.FOR to leave off the --pid=$! argument to
        tail for SYSVER='MAC...'.
        Moved nowhere.

14559.  March 2, 2015           calibration             Eric
        CSLGET fetches the current calibration from the SN/CL table
        data.  It was using time uncertainties of 50 milliseconds in
        the initial search and 400 milliseconds in setting the overall
        range (which determines when new data are sought).  Since data
        may now be taken at 100 milli-second intervals and need
        calibration on that level, this is crazy.  Changed both "slop"
        values to 5 milliseconds.
        Should go to patch after much testing.

14560.  March 6, 2015            VLAMP (GETCDS)          Amy
        VLAMP had a subroutine (CHKBND) in it that was converted to an
        external existing subroutine with more parameters and the same
        name.  The internal subroutine was never removed and caused
        VLAMP to die.
        GETCDS - just removed all the print statments Eric put in to
        help me debug the VLAMP problem, no real change.
        Moved nowhere.

14561.  March 18, 2015       debug lines              Eric
        Removed debug lines from INDXR, PANEL, QCLEAN, QEDIUTIL,
        SPLAT, TVFLG, UVCOP, UVIMG.
        Moved nowhere.


14562.  March 24, 2015        OOP sort                Eric
        OOSRT uses the pseudo-AP for data sorting as does IMAGR and
        other OOP tasks.  The lowest level routines in this sort were
        broken:
        QOSORT   Arguments are DOUBLE PRECISION and LONGINT, call
                 sequence to QPERMA was messed up (to undo errors in
                 QPERMA I suspect)
        QPERMA   Arguments were confused causing completely wrong data
                 rearrangement (if one depended on the comments at the
                 top of the routine).  Also Arguments are DOUBLE
                 PRECISION and LONGINT.
        OOSRT    The OUVSRT routine will copy any SU and AN tables.
                 The table copying at the end needs to omit these two
                 (plus FQ) from the final copy to prevent error
                 conditions being raised.
        Moved nowhere.

14563.  March 24, 2015                LISTR              Eric
        Changed the LIST option to include autocorrelations when DOACOR
        is true.  Added separate scaling at 1/100 for the auto
        amplitudes.
        Moved nowhere.

14564.  March 24, 2015           UV format              Eric
        The BASELINE random parameter limits the number of antennas to
        255 [it is 256 * ant1 + ant2 + (isub-1)/100.0].  Changed to
        allow a different set of random parameters SUBARRAY, ANTENNA1,
        ANTENNA2.  BASELINE will be converted to the new set as the
        data are read in and will be put back to the old BASELINE as
        they are written out, but only when the maximum antenna number
        <= 255.  Changed includes and subroutines:
        DUVH.INC     Added ILOCSA, ILOCA1, ILOCA2.
        DUV3.INC     Removed unused include.
        UVPGET       Added search for the new parameters, changed
                     parameter missing complaint to require either
                     BASELINE or all 3 of the new ones.
        AVERT        Added baseline extraction, changed BL code to be
                     32768 * IANT1 + IANT2
        DATFLG       Baseline pickup, FLGBAS to base 32768

                     otherwise compute a base 4096 baseline number
                     from the two antenna numbers using QVSMA.
        QEDIUTIL     Baseline pickup 3 places, UVDPNT call seq 2
                     places, plus direct fetch of antenna pointers
        QUVUTIL      One call to UVDPNT

                     data sets.  Antenna pickup separately, drop the

14565.  March 24, 2015           SN table                  Eric
        Add dispersion and delta dispersion columns to SN table.
        Changed:
        PUVD.INC    MAXSNC becomes 26 (add 4 columns)
        PSNTAB.INC  Add SNRDS1/2, SNRDD1/2
        SNINI       Add the 4 columns with units, dimensions (1/pol),
                    no complaint if missing or no values
        TABSN       Add the 4 columns when pointers set, DISP(2),
                    DDISP(2) argumnets added after MBDELY, default 0.
        TABLEUTIL   Changed call seq of OTABSN and the call therein to
                    TABSN
        CLCOP       Added DISP/DDISP to polarization switching as well
                    as the 4 calls to TABSN
        SNDUP       Does not use TABSN, but ignoreded MB delay.  Added
                    MB delay and the dispersions (if present).
        SWPOL       Switch the DISP/DDISP for SN as well as CL,
                    correct typo in CL MBDLYs, TABSN call seq

        Added check on the tables if there is an input file rather
        loading from disk.  Also checked on the number of visibilites

14567.  March 26, 2015       More BASELINE               Eric
        References to the BASELINE random parameter were hiding:
        LISRAN      Add new random parms, none are averaged
        UVUTIL      Make 4 places find alternatives to BASELINE and
                    then use them as needed
        QEDIUTIL    Correct fetching of alternative pointers
        RFI         Make 1 place find alternatives to BASELINE and
                    then use them as needed
        BLING       Try alternatives for BASELINE before dying because
                    the task could not set an unused parameter (!)
        IMAGR       BASELINE random parameter was fetched, add the new
                    ones and then use them as an alternative.

14568.  March 27, 2015            FITLD                 Eric
        A short section of essential code did not make it from UVLOD
        into the simple-FITS sections of FITLD causing bad things to

14569.  March 27, 2015                PGNV.INC                Amy
        FITLD was not loading the gain table correctly because the include
        file PGNV.INC had not been relinked when MAXTBGC in PGCV.INC was
        changed.  This meant that FITLD thought there were a possible 200
        gain entries per IF when there were in fact 120.

14570.  March 30, 2015               VLAMP                   Amy
        Changed reference to ANCAL at the top of the output file to ANTAB.

        New task to do image stacking - ignores coordinates, does
        weighted average (or median) of a matching set of images

14573.  April 8, 2015          ANTNUM (VLBAUTIL)             Amy
        ANTNUM would set INVERS to 1 when run.  It tried not to do
        this, by setting VBA_VERS to the INVERS, but ANTNUM called
        MAXTAB and MAXTAB also set VBA_VERS to the INVERS.  Changed
        VBA_VERS to VBA_VERS2.

14574.  April 20, 2015            DBCON               Eric
        The format change is much more complex than what I did.
        The number of pointers and their names needed to be increased
        and special code has to appear to change the data when the 2
        files have different versions of the BASELINE or ANTENNAn
        parameters.
        Moved nowhere.

14575.  April 20, 2015              EDITR              Eric
        This task did not handle the new format of random parameters
        properly.  Fixed QEDIUTIL to use baseline numbers in the old
        form even with data of the new form.  Limits in formats keep
        the task working properly only with MAXANT < 100.  Fixed error
        message to give proper baseline values rather than the coded
        ones.
        Moved nowhere.

14576.  April 20, 2015             RFLAG               Eric
        The call to plot results after flagging was missing an
        argument.  So DOPLOT = -12 et al. did not work although
        a good flag table was made.

14578.  April 21, 2015   START_AIPS, TVSERVERS    Josh Malone/Eric
        Changed ^/tmp to ^/{private/)*/tmp in both scripts to account
        for the new usage in Mac OS 10.10.3  (Yosemite).
        Moved to 15DEC14 24 April.

14579.  April 21, 2015       TVFLG, SPFLG, FTFLG           Eric
        The new option to allow pieces produced code which would try
        to load a window larger than the actual work file when one
        switched back to one piece.  It rounded up by the smoothing
        interval.  Added a MIN of the actual work file number of rows
        to each of the 3 tasks on the ENTER SMOOTH TIME option.
        Moved nowhere.

14582.  April 23, 2015              UVINIT   (!!!!)        Eric
        UV data sets are always supposed to be larger by 4 kilobytes
        than they actually  have to be.  But we have encountered some
        that are exactly the right size for some reason.  In that
        case, if the data set is small enough to fit in the first IO
        buffer, there should be no read into the  second buffer.
        The loop thatstarted the first 1-2 reads skipped the second if
        the count was < 0, but my reading of the code said that the
        count would never be < 0 for the first buffer but could be
        zero.  Changed the LT to a LE.
        Moved to patch and 31DEC13 (for Huib).

14583.  April 23, 2015     START_AIPS, _TVSERVERS    Josh Malone
        Corrected the grammar and typing of the change of 2 days ago.
        With the correction Mac yosemite is friendly again to simple
        aips commands with no TV= options.
        Moved to 15DEC14 24 April.

14584.  April 24, 2015        AIPSMEM117                Eric

14586.  April 28, 2015          UVAVG, ANFIND             Eric
        Changed ANFIND to recognize LOFAR including the UK station
        which should have the other By sign.  LOFAR seems to be using
        a strange antenna coordinate with a small but non-zero array
        center and the Earth radius-like station coordinates.  They
        are using a ???? handedness which is in fact left handed.
        UVAVG had a buffer too small for 54 antennas.  Changed it to
        handle MAXANT.
        Moved nowhere.

14587.  April 29, 2015          CLCOR                Eric
        Fix spelling of milli.
        Add some more statements to bring HA between +- PI.
        For EOPS, changed handling of CLCORP to allow the user to
        actually request day offset 0.  Added info in help file for
        how to do this and why you would want to.
        Moved nowhere.

14588.  April 29, 2015         FITLD                Eric
        Fixes for use of REFDATE:
        1. Trap that RDATE occurs in a table and update the value to
        that of the user.  Times in such files were already updated.
        2. Change AG2AN to receive the user REFDATE and to enforce
        that for RDATE and for the GST at time 0 in the AN file.
        3. Change SO2SU to include the day offset in the JD to which
        we precess to get the apparent coordinates.
        Moved nowhere.

14589.  April 29, 2015           TECOR                 Eric
        The JPL files for TEC include a value at the end of the day
        for midnight.  The file for the next day includes the same
        time, but the data are different.  Presumably, the later file
        was made with information from later in the 2nd day, informing
        the model for 0 hours.  TECOR previously skipped the first
        record of each JPL file afterthe first.  Now it will replace
        the last record of the previous file with the first of the
        current file.  For data in, e.g. March 27, you will now get
        the same answers if you started with the file for the 27th or
        with multiple files starting before the 27th.

14590.  May 1, 2015                OMFIT                   Eric
        Removed a multiplication by sqrt(2) initially suggested by
        Bientenholz on the Uncertainty in the parameters.  Tests
        suggest that it is not correct.
        Worked on the help file to make the help section match the
        inputs section better and to say truth about the code.

14591.  May 1, 2015             COMB                  Eric
        When it has no good idea what to say about the output Stokes,
        COMB used to say -1 (RR).  Now it will say +1, -1, or -5 after
        looking at the input Stokes values.

14592.  May 5, 2015           OBIT jobs                 Eric
        Changed AUO to make some strings longer.  When executing an
        OBIT task and tailing the logfile, 200 characters were not
        enough.
        Moved nowhere.

14593.  May 9, 2015               BPASS                  Eric
        To save work, the task did not divide by the fluxes in the
        source table.  BPMOD was called only if using a model and not
        dividing by channel 0.  It should also be called when doing no
        bandpass normalization and also when the division by channel 0
        is only in phase.

14594.  May 11, 2015             IMAGR                    Eric
        Changed:
        UVMTYP   to have the same bias in favor of DFT as MODFIT
        GRDSUB   to loop over models if the full set does not fit -
                 the fix to UVMTYP should prevent this but it is safer
                 this way.  Call seq of CCSMEM and ALGMEM change.
        CCSMEM   Call sequence to have range of models to do.
        ALGMEM   Call sequence to have range of models to do.

        The change to QCLEAN did not work as intended.  It went into
        REBOX when there was 1 box.  Fixed it to delete single boxes
        without a question.  Added message when doing REBOX instead of
        TVBOX on a TVBOX request.

14597.  May 14, 2015                BPASS                 Eric
        The logical DOMOD meant less than I thought, so the logic in
        calling BPMOD was essentially correct.  Fixed the "fix" of
        14593 plus a bug that caused the task to keep going when no
        data were found.

        GAININ    Computed wavelength as if the reference pixel in
                  frequency is always 1.  It is now usually Nchan/2+1
                  making problems with dispersion and polarization
                  calibrations.
        DATCAL    Required both antennas to have non-zero dispersion
                  to apply the correction.  This leaves out all
                  baselines to the reference antenna.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14599.  May 20, 2015             FITLD                   Eric
        Changed handling of DIGICOR.
        1. It used to lie and claim to do corrections but then if the
           array was not 'VLBA', not actually do them.  Fixed the
           messages tell truth.
        2. Changed DIGICOR in help and Fortran to have values 3 and 4
           mean do the corrections even if not VLBA.  Values 1 and 2
           do the corrections only if VLBA (and 0 -> 1).
        3. Fixed saturation correction to be done only on CORRELAT
           'VLBA' (or ' ' but array VLBA).

14600.  May 20, 2015               XAS                   Eric
        Test for Mac's odd DISPLAY variables dir /tmp but not
        /private/tmp which is now used.  Added the latter so that
        shared memory will be used on Macs.
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14601.  May 25, 2015             UVMOD                  Eric
        The adverb QUAL was used twice in this task for different
        purposes.  Changed the non-standard use to adverb WTUV.
        Moved nowhere.

14602   May 28, 2015              UVUTIL                 Eric
        A vis buffer was parameterized at 30000 to allow 4 * Npol *
        Nif * Mant * Mant.  This would only allow 4 IFs for the VLA!
        Changed it to 1000000 which is too small for 90 antennas and
        90 IFs but is much better.  COMLNKed $QPGOOP and $APGOOP.
        Moved nowhere.

14603.  June 15,2015            Dispersion                 Eric
        Changed:
        PUVD.INC  XCLRSZ had 13*MAXIF - should have been 15*MAXCIF.
        MBDLY     Added an OPTYPE to fit single-band delays with a
                  single multi-band delay plus dispersion.  Output
                  contains dispersion columns with values plus
                  corrected phases and SBdelays.
        CALREF    Changed MBKOLS adding dispersions and changed call
                  to MBDREF.
        MBDREF    Changed call sequence adding a buffer, changed
                  column pointers to (7) pointing at dispersion,
                  and added pickup, smooth, interpolation of
                  dispersion values.
        SN2CL     Changed the buffer sizes - changed 1 or 2 * 1024 to
                  1 or 2 * XCLRSZ (1024 is too small for SN, yet say
                  CL).  Added pointers to dispersion and code to
                  interpolate and copy dispersions (like MBdelay but
                  simpler).
        CLCAL     Made the scratch memory larger for everything and
                  added 2 more parts so that the task could actually
                  smooth multi-band delay and dispersion as
                  advertised.  Added pointers for dispersion in the
                  polynomial fit routine and calls to fit the
                  dispersions.  In the smoothing subroutine, added the
                  buffers for dispesion and MBdelay and did the
                  smoothing in appropriate cases.  Changed buffer size
                  1024 to XCLRSZ in several places (SNFCL does not
                  need a double SN buffer like SN2CL).
        SNSMO     help file: added DELCORR adverbs to set clip level
                  for dispersion and showed other MBdelay parameters
                  are also used for dispersion.
        SNSMO     Added adverb to clip dispersion, added calls to
                  smooth/clip, re-reference, and finally smooth
                  dispersion.  Treated it like MBdelay.
        FRING     Changed call sequence to MBDREF.  Added DISP to KEYS
                  column pointers and fixed up handling of column
                  pointers (all in FRNADJ).  Added routines like in
                  MBDLY to fit the SB delays for MBdelay and
                  dispersion and correct the SB delays and phases for
                  dispersion, writing the full result to the SN table.
        FRING     help file: Add APARM(10) to fit MBdelay plus
                  dispersion (from SB delays).
        Moved nowhere.

14604  June 16, 2015            Dispersion                Eric
       More upgrades:
       MBDREF    Corrected a pointer so it will re-reference
                 dispersion as it was supposed to do.
       KRING     Help: Add adverb DOIFS to control solutions in
                 pieces.  THE FORTRAN HAD THIS ADVERB BUT THE HELP
                 FILE DID NOT.  THIS HAS TO GO TO A PATCH SOMEHOW.
                 Show mode T in inputs for dispersion.
       KRING     (a) Changed call sequence to TABSN -- it was missed
                 somehow!  Added real dispersion values.
                 (b) Changed call sequence to MBDREF.  Added DISP to
                 KEYS column pointers and fixed up handling of column
                 pointers (all in KRNADJ).
                 (c) Dropped requiremet of multi-source.  NX tables
                 are now present on all files.
                 (d) Changed labeling and displayed units of
                 dispersion.
                 (e) If not solving for rates, do the FRING trick of
                 averaging all data in a SOLINT and then making a
                 second copy at a "different" time.  Speed the task a
                 lot!
                 (f) Change conversion routine between SN table units
                 and solution parameters a lot.  It did phases badly
                 when doing delays so that the resulting phases, while
                 flat, were not zero.  It took the dispersion values
                 and adjusted delays - no longer needed since
                 dispersion can go into the SN file.  Also added
                 documentation about the call sequence here.
                 (g) In the fitting routine, corrected phase
                 computation to use the frequency difference rather
                 than a full frequency.

14605.  June 20, 2015              SOUSP                  Eric
        Added SNVER and INVERS to inputs.  Task will adjust gains in
        this range of SN table versions if the user chooses to replace
        the SU table fluxes with the fit fluxes.  Took the SN table
        adjustment routine from GETJY and changed the old fluxes, after
        writing to the SU table, into the ratio of new to old for
        scaling the gains.  Changed $INC/PSNTAB.INC to have format
        version 11 for the new columns and added SNREFM call in the SN
        adjustment routine.
        Changed GETJY to have this extra SNREFM, but it probably does
        not need it since SNREFM was called earlier for all versions.
        Moved nowhere.

14606.  June 22, 2015             POSSM                    Eric
        Added code to make STOKES='HALF' (and RRLL and XXYY) be more
        forgiving if there is only one parallel hand polarization.
        Moved nowhere.

14607.  June 22, 2015                 IMAGR               Eric
        The code that did the baseline-length time averaging copied
        too few spectral channels worth of data to the output buffer
        in the final dump of all remaining baselines (by the number of
        random parameters).
        Moved to 31DEC14 this date.

14608.  June 23, 2015            MOVE                   Eric
        Changed from ZFIO (1 kilobyte per I/O) to a large buffer with
        ZMIO up to 64 Megabytes per I/O.  This makes a ten-times speed
        up in some cases.
        Moved nowhere.

14609.  June 24, 2015           CAPLT, CLPLT              Eric
        There were some logic difficulties when the earliest scan did
        not have data for all baselines of a triangle.
        Moved nowhere.

14610.  June 25, 2015           PIPEAIPS                  Lorant
        Included PIPEAIPS as clone of current DOOSRO to advertise it
        with a more general name for data reduction of connected
        element interferometers. Maybe more people will find it in
        the distribution and make use of it.
        Moved nowhere.

14611.  June 26, 2015                BLING                 Eric
        Corrected handling of times in NX tables by adding 0.02 sec
        to the length of the scan.  Also changed the NX handling to
        avoid changing the source number when one is past the last
        calibrator scan.  Changed it to force starting over in the NX
        table at each scan.
        Moved nowhere.

14612.  June 30, 2015           AIPSLetter                Eric
        Put in $AIPSPUBL/LET15A.{TEX,PS,PDF} the June 30, 2015
        AIPSLetter.
        AIPSPUBL goes everywhere.

14613.  July 1, 2015          REVERSN                    Eric
        NEW VERB added to POPSDAT, NEWPARMS plus AU3 and a new help
        file.  This verb looks on disk for all possible extension
        files and updates the header.
        Moved nowhere.

14614.  July 2, 2015            PRTMSG                  Eric
        Chamged PRTMSG (Fortran) to ask the user to confirm jobs that
        will possibly print > 600 lines to the actual line printer.
        Added comment to the help file also.  No confirmation required
        for batch jobs, text file outputs, etc.
        Moved nowhere.

14615.  July 2, 2015              FLOPM                Eric
        The low level routine UVGET can alter the frequency of the
        data when the frequency offset of IF 1 is not zero.  But it
        does not scale u,v,w for this alteration!  Fixed FLOPM to grab
        the initial frequency and the final frequency and scale
        appropriately.
        Moved nowhere.

14616.  July 7, 2015          UVLOD, FITLD             Eric
        These tasks read index tables written by FITTP and FITAB.
        When reading the former it is possible to have UV records
        discarded if they are completely flagged (under control of
        DOKEEP).  Added subroutine NXCHCK to both tasks to check if
        there is an index table and if so does the peak vis record
        number match the peak of the vis file just written.  If not,
        the NX table is recomputed (or created new if no input table
        was provided).  This covers for the lack of NX tables from
        CASA and for odd behaviors when records are omitted.
        Moved nowhere.

14617.  July 8, 2015         UVLOD, FITLD                 Eric
        Pulled NXCHCK out as a separate $APLNOT subroutine.  Changed
        both and RUVTAB to honor DOKEEP with UV binary tables, report
        the number of records omitted, and compress the UV file
        accordingly.  Previously, this operation was done on random
        groups format only.
        Moved nowhere.

14618.  July 8, 2015               PRTHI                   Eric
        Changed AU7 to ask for confirmation on line-printer jobs
        potentially greater than 500 lines.  Note added to PRTHI help
        file.
        Moved nowhere.

14619.  July 9, 2015             UVHOL                 Eric
        Change WTUV in HOLG from unlimited (if positive) to 1.0 if
        outside the range 0.1 to 10.  Fix help file to admit to the
        allowed scaling in HOLG and to include a paragraph to explain
        why one will want to do scaling whenever the IF came from a
        copy of the UV data with IF selection.

14620.  July 9, 2015                LISTR              Eric
        Added the reference channel value in header of Frequency Table
        listing.  Corrected the format of that listing.
        Moved nowhere.

14621.  July 10, 2015           TV3COLOR               Eric
        Changed AU5 and the help to have this verb use TVCHAN to
        specify the first of the 3 channels/colors.
        Useful for the next item in particular.
        Moved nowhere.

14622.  July 10, 2015            EDIT Class            Eric
        When editing with CROWDED true, it is useful to try to
        differentiate the various IFs and polarizations with color.
        The option to do so has been added to the EDIT class with some
        3-color support n the TV device class.
        Changed:
        EDITA      Fortran and help: add adverb DO3COL
        EDITR      Fortran and help: add adverb DO3COL
        SNEDT      Fortran and help: add adverb DO3COL
        TVDEVICE   Add TVDLN3 to draw lines in grey levels in 3 colors
                   in channels CHAN to CHAN+2.  Added OPTYPE='TV3C' to
                   turn on 3 consecutive channels in RGB.
        QEDIUTIL   Added keyword DO3COLOR which is allowed to be true
                   only when CROWDED is also true.  Added ED3CIN to
                   turn on channels 14-16 is RGB and initialize a set
                   of colors for all the IFs and polarizations.  Added
                   code to trun off these channels at the end.  Added
                   ED3LIN to call TVDLIN or TVDLN3 depending on
                   DO3COL.  Added lots of places to set COLOR to point
                   at the current polarization/IF being plotted.  In
                   EDPLT1, changed to call ED3LIN for the edit area
                   plot and to init these grey-scale planes to zero.
                   In EDPLTP, added calls to ED3LIN when plotting the
                   edit data.  Corrected NEXT POL/IF functions to
                   include all polarizations and all IFs in the cycle
                   as appropriate.
        Moved nowhere.

14623.  July 13, 2015           gfortran                Eric
        Sites trying to compile their own versions of AIPS have had
        some difficulties.  Changed:
        OPTIMIZE.LIS   APCLN to be done at level 1 (commented out for
                       main distributed version)
        PAPC.INC       Parameter PKPWRD added, defined as 2, commented
                       version 200000000
        DAPC.INC       APCORE is size PKPWRD rather than 2.
        QINIT.FOR      Add code for a fixed size AP when PKPWRD>1000
                       with error message if request larger than
                       allowed.  Dynamic allocation remains otherwise.
        ZTXOP2         gfortran makes the file unwritable when the
                       end-of-file is read but offers an APPEND option
                       in the OPEN.  g77 does not allow this option so
                       changed code on append to read to EOF counting
                       records.  Then close, re-open, and read just
                       the right number of records leaving it just
                       before the EOF.
        Moved nowhere.

14624.  July 13, 2015             CALIB                  Eric
        Fixed one RPOL/LPOL label to also do XPOL/YPOL when
        appropriate.
        Moved nowhere.

14625.  July 14, 2015               gfortran               Eric
        Upgraded the options a bit in $SYSLNX64 versions of
        FDEFAULT.SH and LDOPTS.SH.
        Moved nowhere.

14626.  July 14, 2015          gfortran               Eric
        gfortran does not save local variable values from one
        invocation of a subroutine to the next.  This may be a
        wide-spread issue.  Fixed so far including warning fix ups:
        AVER    work routine did no SAVEs and needed many
        BASRM   buffer way too small for possible numbers of channels,
                may not work for compressed data (INCX ignored)
        BLAVG   SAVE was done but some variables missed, buffer too
                small too
        BSMAP   SAVE was done, some missed
        UVMOD   SAVE needed for number IFs, etc.
        Moved nowhere.

14627.  July 16, 2015        Side band                Eric
        TABFQ actually forces the sideband code to +1 and, if it
        encounters a negative sideband code on input, forces the
        channel increment to negative.  Some places still multiply the
        increment by the sideband code, so fix these in
        ACTFRQ   DBCON   FXVLA  HAFIX  PCLOD  SETJY  TBAVG  UVFIX
        UVLIN    UVLSD   UVLSF
        Also changed:
        AVSPC    Averaged channels in the SUBS option from N to 1 by
                 -1 for "lower sideband" including all ATCA data.
                 This makes the header and FQ table be incorrect.
        CVEL     Shift direction based on sign of frequency increment
                 rather than band code.
        PCVEL    Shift direction based on sign of frequency increment
                 rather than band code.
        POSSM    FFT direction based on sign of frequency increment
                 rather than band code in auto- and cross-correlation
                 plots.
        Moved nowhere.

14628.  July 17, 2015          gfortran                 Eric
        More SAVES needed:
        DESCM   DESCDO needed 2 initialized at 1st call, lots of code
                upgrades to avoid GO TOs, unused statement numbers.
        DTSIM   GETGST needs to remember values from previous call
                (DTPM.INC needed TAB characters removed.)
        FILLM   VLMDAT needed some SAVEs, unused arguments, excess

                statement labels
        MWFLT   A large number of variables needed to be SAVEd since
                they are computed once per plane only.  Moderate
                coding upgrades too to reduce warnings and GO TOs.
        NINER   Required some variables to be SAVEd at the start of
                each plane.  Required serious rearrangement of code to
                make it readable.  KRSH required two corrections - the
                code stepped around the matrix too much and so did
                only 4 of the 8 cases and then it took max(1,result)
                as the result.  That would be okay I guess if the data
                were >> 1 butthey are not.  Corrected help file too.
        NNLSQ   The working routine required a few SAVEs, code needed
                IF-THEN-ELSE rather than GO TOs with lots of labels.
        SHADW   DIDDLE required a few SAVEs
        SPLAT   AVGTIM required a few SAVEs

        WIPER had typos causing it to have 0 as the antenna numbers
        and so to treat everything as an auto-correlation.  WIPER and

        Flag commands in QEDIUTIL are assigned times which attempt to

        Improved automatic scan selection, by testing all antennas are
        present in selected scan and if not going to next calibrator
        in calibrator list.  If no scan is present with all the
        antennas on a calibrator, then script stops and asks the user
        to input timerange.
        In plotting: 1) added UVPLT plots after all the calibration;
        2) fixed bug for final phase (VPLOT) plots to plot only
        baselines to refant;

        IMAGE    The change caused the scratch file number to be zero

        OMFIT had a vast number of FORMATs that were not used and a
        variety of labels that were also unused.  It creates dynamic
        memory variables and then calls subroutines with them.  Fixed
        the call sequence types via making EQUIVALENCEd variables of
        the correct type to the variables referenced for dynamic
        memory.  There was one variable that is used heavily as a real
        array in one routine and then COMPLEX in many below that.  So
        one warning has been left.  Also found a significant place
        where a SAVE is required.

        When doing models (at least), the task failed to notice when a
        channel was fully flagged and died later.  Changed so that the
        initial data copying would notice this problem.  I suspect
        that the route through the task for solving for a model
        noticed the absence of data later and handled it.  Also fixed
        unused labels and, with global equivalences, some mismatches.
        Should go to patch.

        The dynamic memory allocation for DOSCALE in 31DEC15 was
        enough only for one source.  If more than one were included an
        abort of some sort would occur.  It is supposed to be for 10
        sources and the task enforces that.

        The creation of the ST table caused the new MF table to
        disappear from the header.  Changed to use the correct header
        version in the STINI call.
        Moved to patch 7 Sept.

14683.  September 9, 2015          XG2PL               Eric
        NEW TASK: plots the Gaussian fit at a pixel along with the
        Zeman fit at that pixel.  The data, the model, the model
        components, and/or the residuals may be plotted for the I data
        and XGAUS model plus the V data and the ZEMAN model.
        Also changed:
        ZEINI   Pulled from ZEMAN and given an extra argument DOGAUS
                which indicates how the derivatives are computed.
        TABZE   Pulled from ZEMAN.
        ZEMAN   Gave up the above and adjusted to the new ZEINI call
                sequence.  Found bad test in slopes computation for
                one-sided.

14686.  September 14, 2015          PCAL                Eric
        The SPECTRAL false mode was broken - it did not handle the

14687.  September 14, 2015          XG2PL               Eric
        (1) Fixed status handling to make cataloged plot files.
        (2) Added ability to print solution values at up to 100 pixels
        (3) Print will include all channels so BLC1 is always 1 and
            XBAR=-CATR(KRCRP) so drop any providing of XGAUS BLC/TRC.
        (4) Change APARM(9,10) to APARM(7,8) to specify averaging area
            and add APARM(9) to select inclusion of pixels with no
            model (default is to omit them).
        (5) Fix scaling of V-only plot.
        (6) Correct character count for characters to left to include
            the max from each of the 2 plots.
        (7) Fix bad error code variable.
        (8) Fix selection of lines to plot in V (used I codes).
        (9) Put polarization label inside plot, not on Y axis.
        (10) Fix inputs comments on BPARM and add help on CPARM(4) the
            x-axis type.

14688.  September 16, 2015           RM2PL               Eric
        NEW TASK: like XG2PL but to plot models from RMFIT rather than
        those from XGAUS/ZEMAN.  Changes:
        RMFIT    Extract RMINI and TABRM subroutines.
        RMINI    Extracted from RMFIT, add DOSPIX value as keyword.
        TABRM    Extracted from RMFIT.
        XG2PL    Help - correct averaging comments, mention printing
                 of model values at each pixel in the average
        XG2PL    Find auto-scale values only from plotted range of
                 channels.  Correct scaling initialization used to
                 count characters at the left for using only part of

14690.  September 16, 2015    AIPS Memo 118                Eric
        Revised AIPS Memo 118 to mention XG2PL and RM2PL in some
        detail including example plots.  Include TEX, PDF and a

14693.  September 25, 2015           XGAUS             Eric
        Changed to
        (1) Make the XG table for the full input image - output
            residual image will be full size.
        (2) Use the user's BLC/TRC as a subimage from the start.
        (3) Dropped BCHAN and ECHAN and added ORDER to control the
            solving of no baseline, DC baseline, or linear baseline.
            The initial guess for baseline is always zero.  Changed
            handling of baseline parameter(s) many mnay places.
        (4) In TV display of images, added SET and RESET WINDOW to
            allow the user to look at sub-images in detail.
        (5) Corrected handling out OUTSEQ.  The same value was
            required previously for all parameter images even when
            OUTSEQ = 0.
        (6) Changed help about XG table full size and SET/RESET
            WINDOW.  Also HLPGAUS.HLP about the SET and RESET WINDOW
            options.
        Moved nowhere.

14694.  September 25, 2015          ZEMAN              Eric
        Changed to
        (1) Make the ZE table for the full input image - output
            residual and corrected image will be full size.
        (2) Use the user's BLC/TRC as a subimage from the start - the
            previous version did the full ZE-table image always on
            restarts.
        (3) In TV display of images, added SET and RESET WINDOW to
            allow the user to look at sub-images in detail.
        (6) Changed help about ZE table full size and SET/RESET
            WINDOW.  Also HLPZEMAN.HLP about the SET and RESET WINDOW
            options.
        Moved nowhere.

14695.  September 25, 2015          RMFIT              Eric
        Changed to
        (1) Make the RM table for the full input image - output
            residual images will be full size.
        (2) Use the user's BLC/TRC as a subimage from the start - the
            previous version did the full ZE-table image always on
            restarts.
        (3) In TV display of images, added SET and RESET WINDOW to
            allow the user to look at sub-images in detail.
        (4) For writing out images, corrected the setting of the flags
            so that parameters will be written, corrected the setting
            out the OUTSEQ so that all output images do not have to
            have the same sequence number (if OUTSEQ 0), and corrected
            the computation of the uncertainties in Q0 and U0.
        (5) Changed help about RM table full size and SET/RESET
            WINDOW.  Also HLPRMFIT.HLP about the SET and RESET WINDOW
            options.
        Moved nowhere.

14696.  September 25, 2015            PATGN                  Eric

14698.  September 25, 2015            RMSD                   Eric
        Put in code to check for no valid pixels in a window and
        return blanks instead of NaNs.  Curtailed excessive message,
        printing once plus a summary of the number of times it
        recurred in the least-squares.  Robust works better than
        histogram.
        Moved nowhere.

14699.  September 26, 2015          MFPRT                Eric
        1. Changed to scale in micro-Jy when appropriate
        2. FLUX cutoff changed to apply to beam-correct total flux
        3. Units test changed to be case indepepndent in determining
           Jy and Jy/beam.

14700.  September 26, 2015           OMFIT              Eric
        Changed Fortran to avoid writing 3 records into one string
        (made it 3 writes and ZTXIO calls) and to make NOISE(1) <=
        0 be +1.0.  Previously it set it -1.0 and then scaled
        CHI-squared with the actual post-fit rms which makes good and
        bad fits look equal.  Changed help to indicate that NOISE(1)
        is that part of the noise not reflected in the weights.  If
        the data weights are calibrated in 1/Jy^2 then NOISE(1) should
        be 1.0.  If they are 1.0, then NOISE(1) should be the real
        (average) rms noise in Jy.  All of this really only to find
        the CHI-squared values.

14701.  September 28, 2015           TYSMO               Eric
        Changed maximum number of times to 110000 (> 30 hours at 1

        Moved nowhere.

14702.  September 28, 2015          BPASET               Eric
        DOBAND init routine does not work optimized with gfortran.
        Changed OPTIMIZE.LIST for LNX64 since the routine is not
        called all that much.
        Moved nowhere.

14703.  September 28, 2015       UVMOD                Eric
        Corrected number parameters adding 1.  FQCENT was always zero
        previously.
        UVPRT - dropped unused formats, labels
        Moved nowhere.

14704.  September 30, 2015           Units           Eric
        MFPRT   Needed units=' ' for primary-beam and bandwidth
                correction factors
        Also changed to handle the units in a case-insensitive
        fashion:
        MFINI   FACSET  COMB    MCUBE   PRTIM   FQUBE   IM2CC
        IMFIT   JMFIT   CONVL   FFT     IM2UV   BLSUM   IMEAN

14706.  October 8, 2015       AIPS Memo 118              Eric
        Revised the memo to discuss the 31DEC15 version of XGAUS,
        ZEMAN, RMFIT, XG2PL, RM2PL, and the modeling tasks.  New text
        is in red, some figures were updated.
        Moved everywhere in $AIPSPUBL.

14709.  October 9, 2015        DELZN, CLCOR               Eric
        In DELZN, added a SAVE, dropped unused labels and formats,
        cleaned up typing.  Added DISP opcode to solve for dispersion
        as another 1/sin(elevation) parameter allowing it to plot and
        write a text file for CLCOR.  Clarified what is plotted in the
        help file.  Added DISP OPCODE to CLCOR to read the output from
        DELZN for dispersion and apply it to the CL table.  Everything
        was tested with a real DELZN data set modified by a special
        version of UVMOD which makes clock error delays plus
        1/sin(elev) delays and dispersions.
        Moved nowhere.

14710.  October 12, 2015           install.pl              Eric
        Watching a large number of VLB students install AIPS produced
        suggestions to attempt to reduce difficulties:
        (1) Setting $AIPS_ROOT, tell user not to include blanks and
        then check that there were none.
        (2) Data area names: tell not to use ones including NRAO or
        OARN because they have special meaning and make other
        suggestions.
        (3) Tell user that blanks are not allowed in data area paths.
        (4) If no data areas are given, make the suggested area be the
        full list.  (It gets created and given SPACE kater.)
        (5) Save services information to repeat at the end if needed.
        Put repeated info about defining services at end.
        (6) At end, add lines meant to draw attention to the text and
        add /etc/sysctl.conf details when arch is MACINT.  Also
        mention .bashrc, .tchsrc, and .chhrc files.
        (7) Changed wording in laptop question and made Y the default.
        Moved nowhere.

14711.  October 12, 2015            UVCOP                   Eric
        UVCOP tried to avoid work and so did not adjust the FQ offsets
        when copying 1 FQ table from BIF=1.  If the offset of IF 1 was
        not zero, this was bad.  Changed to adjust always even if by
        zero.

14712.  October 12, 2015         FRING, RLDLY                Eric
        Added warning in help files.  APARM(5) or DOIFS > 0 will not
        work if the frequency increment between IFs in a group of IFs
        has the opposite sign from the frequency increment between

14713.  October 12, 2015               SNIFS                 Eric
        Did not do the page full test properly and so died trying to
        open an already open TV.
        Moved nowhere.

14714.  October 13, 2015           FLOPM                  Eric
        Added OPTYPE 'IFON' to flop only IFs leaving channels alone.
        Moved nowhere.

14715.  October 26, 2015             VBGLU                Eric
        The double precision offset into the dynamic memory was not
        updated when the dynamic memory was reassigned.  This led to
        an abort in the table copying.
        Moved nowhere (31DEC15 bug).

14716.  October 29, 2015            DBCON                Eric
        Changed:
        1. Added option to use the previous NX (Index) tables to
        define the scans as best as possible.  Added subroutine DBNXGT
        to set up the tables a la RNXGET.
        2. Made unrecognized sort codes emerge as '*'
        3. Fixed frequency ID setup which mixed a counter of number of
        FQ tables in the 2 data sets with a pointer to FQID number
        which needs to be a separate and much larger array.
        Moved nowhere.

14717.  October 29, 2015        Mac El Capitan       Eric/Josh Malone
        Changed install.pl to mention a new script that should allow
        users of Mac OS X 10.11 ("El Capitan") to run AIPS.  The
        script was saved in $SYSMACIN as fix_aips_elcap.sh.
        Moved nowhere.

14718.  October 29, 2015              FRING               Eric
        Put in a check for frequency increments of opposite sign
        between channels in a group of IFs and the IF center
        frequencies.  The task does not get good solutions in such
        cases and so should quit and recommend FLOPM.
        Moved nowhere.

14719.  November 2, 2015             RLDLY                Eric
        Added APARM for control parameters:
        APARM(1)   SNRMIN, 0 _ 5 which was the previous fixed value
        APARM(2)   > 0 do not write CL table when have 1 cal scan
        APARM(3)   Max delay error in ns allowed to be included in
                   averaging, 0 -> 1000000.
        The task now always writes an SN table.
        IFs with failed solutions now get delay and phase of 0 not
        magic blanks to avoid deleting data.
        The display of the answers written to the SN and CL tables now
        includes not just the formal error but also the rms over the
        reference antennas.
        Moved nowhere.

14720.  November 9, 2015         PUTHEAD, GETHEAD           Eric
        The full range of available PTYPEn was not shown in the
        explain files.
        Moved nowhere.

14721.  November 9, 2015           FITTP                  Eric
        FITTP did not handle random parameters after ANTENNA1/2
        in the list properly.  If CORR-ID was after ANTENNA2 then the
        CORR-ID parameter was labeled ANTENNA1 bit contained the
        corr-id values (usually all 1).
        Moved nowhere.

14722.  November 10, 2015          OOP                    Eric
        UVPGET returns pointers to the last occurrence of the various
        strings - e.g. if ANTENNA1 occurs twice in the list of random
        parameters, UVPGET returns a pointer to the second one which
        turns out to be what one wanted.  In UVDESC.FOR subroutine
        UVDFND returned a pointer to the first occurrence.  Corrected
        it to do the same as UVPGET.  The ANTENNA1 bug in FITTP thus
        affected BLING, IMAGR, OMFIT, DTSUM, and RFI only.
        Moved nowhere.

14723.  November 10, 2015     multi-panel plots          Eric
        The plot buffer needs to be SAVEd to make sure that it is
        preserved between calls to plot the panels of a multi-panel
        plot.  They have seemed to work without this, but there is no
        harm in it and the SAVE should be necessary.  Tasks changed:
        BLSUM   ANBPL   CONFI   DELZN   ELINT   GCPLT   PBEAM
        POSSM   SNFIT   SNIFS   SNPLT   VPLOT   WETHR
        SAVEd also CHOUT in BLSUM.  The rest had put CHOUT in an
        included COMMON as a rather global SAVE.
        Moved nowhere.

14724.  November  10, 2015         IMSTAT                Eric
        The limits in the help file for BLC did not include BLC(1)=-1
        for a circular aperture.  Fixed that and a typo.

14725.  November 11, 2015            ALVAR                 Eric
        NEW TASK (old ALVAR renamed ALVPR) - plots Allan Variance of
        complex or phase with true mean or robust mean computation.
        Averages over channels and IFs and can plot baseline by
        baseline or the global average of the Allan Variances over all
        selected baselines.  Plots can be linear in X or Y or log in X

        Moved nowhere.

14728.  November 13, 2015            install.pl            Eric
        Move the $SYSMACIN/fix_aips_elcap.sh information to just
        before the attempt to RUN FILAIP (where the fix will be
        needed).  Add a pause (hit return when ready) line to allow
        time to do that operation in another window.
        Moved nowhere.

14729.  November 13, 2015            ALVAR                 Eric

        Moved nowhere.

14730.  November 16, 2015         ATLOD                   Eric
        The LUN for the tape drive was not corrected when ZTPOPN was
        changed to use lun = 129 - INTAPE and so the ZTPOPN failed.
        $AIPNOT/RDFITS also had this problem.
        Moved nowhere.

14731.  November 17, 2015              ATLOD               Eric
        Fixed the task to get INTAPE to the TAPIO initialization
        routine as well as to the file skipping routine.  Fixed buffer
        mismatch a bunch of places to reduce the number of warning
        messages considerably.  The INTAPE thing required moving the
        variable to another include.  How did it work when the TAPIO
        call always assumed tape device 1?
        Moved nowhere.

14732.  November 18, 2015          ANTAB                 Eric
        Removed the prohibition against multiple subarray data, but
        left warning messages in the Fortran and the help files.
        It is tempting to write subarray 0 for all subarrays, but I am
        afraid that APCAL might not support that fully.
        Moved nowhere.

14733.  November 18, 2015            DOVLAMP            Eric
        Edited the help file to reformat long lines and to replace
        "CLCOR" with "CLCAL" which is what is actually used.
        Moved nowhere.

14734.  November 19, 2015             EVAUV               Eric
        Added SMODEL adverb and functionality to allow comparing a
        point model to the data instead of the image CC model.
        Much of the code already supported this, but DOPTMD was always
        false so it was not used.  The one thing lost when using
        SMODEL is the analysis of the true RMS of the images.
        Moved nowhere.

14735.  November 20, 2015      VLBARUN, VLBAUTIL          Amy
        Incorporate new amp cal scheme described in VLBA Scientific
        Memo #37 (Craig Walker), which changes to VLBARUN and VLBAUTIL.
        Changes to VLBAUTIL:
          1) new proc VLBACCOR - runs ACCOR, SNSMO and CLCAL
          2) new proc VLBABPSS - runs BPASS, ACSCL, SNSM0 and CLCAL
          3) new proc VLBAAMP  - runs APCAL and CLCAL
          4) added message to VLBACALA saying you shouldn't use this.
        Changes to VLBARUN:
          1) remove VLBACALA
          2) replace VLBACALA and change order of calibration to:
                - VLBACCOR -- digital sampling corrections
                - VLBAMPCL (or VLBAPCOR) -- remove instrumental delay
                - VLBABPSS -- do bandpass and correct auto-correlations
                - VLBAAMP -- a priori amplitude calibration
          3) not related to amplitude calibration, improved several
             things about how the images were produced (e.g. auto-boxing
             was not set up properly).
          4) not related to amplitude calibration, fixed adding images/
             uvplots to .html file.
          5) not related to amplitude calibration, added the ability to
             correct data with a DELZN produced file.
         Help files:
          1) added warning to VLBACALA help file that it should not be
             used.
          2) added new procs to VLBAUTIL help file
        Moved nowhere.

14736.  November 23, 2015       VLBARUN, VLBAUTIL           Amy
        While editing to cookbook I realized that I created VLBABPSS and
        VLBAAMP with not the most logical seperation of tasks (except to
        maybe for Craig since he would prefer APCAL by itself).  I took
        ACSCL (and SNSMO and CLCAL) out of VLBABPSS and put them in
        VLBAAMP.  This required a small change to VLBARUN and the help
        files for VLBABPSS and VLBAAMP.
        Also edited VLBAMPCL.HLP and VLBAPCOR.HLP so that they give the
        correct recomendation of the order to run the VLBAUTIL procedures.

14737.  November 23, 2015            UVMOD               Eric
        Did not address visibility data correctly when BIF > 0 in the
        model computation routine.  Frequently this would mean that no
        model was applied to the output data.
        Moved nowhere.

14738.  November 23-24, 2015            IMFIT               Eric
        Found a bunch of variables that needed SAVEing in IMFMOD and 2
        in FCN itself.  Modernized the code style in IMFMOD, IMFERR,
        and elsewhere.
        Moved nowhere.

14739.  November 24, 2015           CLCOR                 Eric
        EOPS is for all data sets with a proper CT table, not just the
        VLBA correlator.  This now includes DiFX correlators and,
        recently, even the EVLA (when data come into AIPS vis BDF2AIPS
        = OBIT's BDFIn).  changed comments and messages in Fortran and
        help files.
        Moved nowhere.

14740.  November 25, 2015            TYSMO                Eric
        When there was only 1 polarization, the setting of the
        pointers to the second one was -1.  When the IF number was
        added to this to do IFs 2-n, the number was no longer negative
        and the lower level routines attempted to do things with
        non-existant values.  The SY table then ended up trashed.
        Changed the -1's to -1000's.  Improved labeling of Psys and
        corrected some minor issues in the help file.
        Made GETCDS check for number polarizations and not complain
        about the non=existant 2nd polarization.
        Moved nowhere.

14741.  November 26, 2015             PCAL                Eric

        Changed the options for gfortran to those I would recommend.
        The -Wall makes a message for every integer = float statement

14746.  December 6-7, 2015        fix_aips_elcap           Eric
        The Xwindows libraries had an extra close parentheses in their
        names for no good reason.  The nice loop that Josh wrote gave
        a file name of *.dylib for one of the links so changed to make
        it do the 3 files by the names they are known to have.
        Dec 7: Josh wrote a proper test on Xwindows rather than
        linking the files bu force.  His loop looks okay but gives odd
        results on El Cap so left my explicit file linking.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14747.  December 8, 2015        EDIT class             Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL at NEXT ANTENNA.  It failed when there was
        only one antenna other than the edited one and that antenna
        was the next antenna.  Now it will start upping the second
        antenna number to one more than the edit one.

        It treated the fact that one CL record was below the horizon
        as a fatal error.  Changed to count the below horizon
        indicators and report that number plus the total at the end.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14749.  December 15, 2015           install.pl          Eric

14750.  December 16, 2015             UVFLG              Eric
        The text-file reading got confused about times which it set to
        minus the day number.  Then it tested if both were zero.
        Added test for both = minus the day number and changed the
        complaint to allow time1=time2 which should not occur.
        INTEXT reading did not re-initialize all adverb values between
        commands leading to later commands inheriting parameters from
        the previous ones.  Simplified the re-initialization to be all
        inclusive.

        Found out that data points with some but not all polarizations
        flagged would persist in the data selection and cause problems

        Changed to do linear polarization model only when the data are
        linear and CPARM(5) > 0.  That model does not seem to work and
        circular (APPR) does when the source model has zero for
        polarized flux.

14758.  December 22, 2015         IRING               Eric
        The geometry was questioned by a user and was reviewed in
        detail.  The radii were increased erroneously by a division by
        cos(inclination) but the rest of the geometry was found to be
        correct.  Changed the task to have OUTTEXT='NONE' suppress
        both the text and message file outputs.  Also changed it to
        honor the Y axis range in CPARM(9,10) when CPARM(8)>0.
        Previously it honored it only when the values did not exceed
        the stated range.

14759.  December 28, 2015           PBEAM                Eric
        Changed the task the handle data in any order.  Previously it
        demanded that the data lie in columns on the sky, although
        there was some confusion with a row-ordered plan also.
        Changed the plots to be contour plots and to write out the
        data. model. and residual images.  Previous plots were row
        traces.  Corrected a minor issue in EVAUV's contouring.

14761.  December 29, 2015         PBEAM                 Eric
        Found a variable that was not initialized which caused the
        task to fail to read the data the second time in which the
        normalization was supposed to have been done.  Added APARM(9)
        to control the width of the convolving function which was too
        narrow before.  Re-named the axes and made the X axis right
        handed.  Made less drastic contour intervals for the residual

        Correct the amplitude image by the pixel-dependent sum of
        weights making the image be an interpolated one rather than a
        convolved one.  Also normalize that image and make unsampled
        pixels be magic blanks.

14763.  December 29, 1015         holography              Eric
        Further changes:
        UVHOL   Was limited to documenting only 14 averaged antennas.
                Changed to write more than one line (like ref ants)
        HOLOG   Changed to subtract the phase at the pixel of peak
                amplitude from the phase image, thereby "normalizing"
                phases as well as amplitudes.
        PBEAM   Changed parsing of text file to free format and added
                parsing of the Averaged antennas and Averaged RefAnts
                input lines.  Changed display of antennas and refants
                to support the full (possible) lists.

14768.  January 7, 2016         GC tables             Eric
        Changed PGCV.INC back to allow up to 200 values (per
        polarization, per IF, per antenna) for the Y and gain.  Some
        correlators write out 200 values (almost all magic blanks)
        even though they have no use for them.
        Moved to 31DEC15 (patch) this date.

14770.  January 12, 2016        PBEAM                  Eric
        Corrected a subscript error that made the addition of RR and
        LL to make Stokes I get scaled incorrectly.  Also fixed a
        format issue telling the user the re-scaling factor.
        Moved fixes only to 31DEC15.

14771.  January 13, 2016          RLDLY               Eric
        The output SN table was written to "CLOVER" which could be set
        to some non-zero value if a new CL table was also written.
        Fixed to always write a new SN table and improved the history
        writing as well.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14772.  January 15, 2016           FITLD                Eric
        Two subroutines GNINI and TABGN were not compiled when PGCV
        was changed.  They include an include that includes PGCV and
        so have to be compiled.  Then FITLD needs to be relinked.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14774.  January 19, 2016        EDITA, EDITR            Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL to make the all-source status false to begin
        with.  Corrected the expansion of times in flags to avoid
        going a long way in one direction due to a gap in the selected
        data in the work space.
        Moved to 31DEC15 (patch) this date.

14781.  January 28, 2016             DBCON               Eric
        DBCON reinstated flagged table rows.  Changed to drop
        them completely.  Number of output records had to be fixed
        in output table header.
        Moved to 31DEC15 (patch) this date.

14789.  February 9, 2016            DTSUM                Eric
        Typo meant that it did not interpret the new UV format
        correctly and assigned all baselines to the same
        autocorrelation.
        Moved to 31DEC15 (patch) this date.

14814.  April 15, 2016           PCAL                  Eric
        The baseline pickup for one of two data copies had the
        handling of the new antenna format wrong!  IA2 was not set so
        I do not see how it could work.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14816.  April 16, 2016             PCAL                Eric
        Changed the handling in RPCALC and LPCALC of times for which
        the I model has value 0.  It reports it but keeps going so
        long as the weight is also zero.  This was caused by the
        ionospheric Faraday rotation being blanked for reasons I
        cannot discover - probably relating to flagging being applied
        to the CL table.
        Moved to 31DEC15 April 29 without DPARM.

14820.  April 29, 2016             PCAL                   Eric
        Found what was wrong - the Faraday rotation values were lost
        entirely when an IF was copied to a scratch file before
        pulling out individual channels.  Changed it to:
        (1) Not delete the ION file when killing other scratch files
        except between IFs.  Zero scratch pointers when deleting the
        scratch file.
        (2) Create a new ION scratch file when needed before the copy
        of the individual IF to its scratch file and write the ION as
        that copy is done
        (3) Do the ION file with the data read only when not doing
        spectral solutions as opposed to always doing it.  Values are
        not available if the IF was moved to a scratch.
        Subroutine $QNOT/GRDSUB has to defend itself when pointers to
        SCRGRD and SCRWRK point at improper values (outside NSCR or
        disk or cno <= 0).
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14826.  May 10, 2016             IMAGR                  Eric
        Changed QCLEAN - it had some wrong subscripts when testing
        islands for making automatic boxes.  If IMSIZE(2) < IMSIZE(1)
        then islands would be found only for X values less than
        IMSIZE(2) - i.e.the left half, quarter, etc of the image.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14829.  May 19, 2016         Edit Class                 Eric
        The routines used by SNEDT and EDITA to read in the table data
        allowed source number column values <= 0.  But the flagging
        routines with "ONE SOURCE" would not write a flag record if no
        source number > 0 was found.  Fixed EDGT SN, TY, SY in
        QEDIUTIL to force the source number to be 1 or greater.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14842.  June  16, 2016           UVFIX                  Eric
        UVFIX goes to a lot of work to find the actual frequency of
        each data sample.  However, the definition of U,V,W is
        wavelengths at the header frequency not wavelengths at the
        real frequency.  Changed scaling of U, V, W accordingly.
        Normally, AIPS keeps the offset of the first IF zero so this
        would not matter normally.  But CASA/ALMA has no such
        scruples.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14787.  February 5, 2016          install.pl            Eric
        Changed error messages around the make of XAS to point out
        that fixing Makefile and doing a make in $YSERV/XAS is all
        that is needed.  Also added $CCOMOPT in the rewrite of the
        Makefile before the make.
        Moved to 31DEC15 June 23.

14847.  June 23, 2016             install.pl             Eric
        I wanted to show the user $CDTST but perl insists on
        translating that so changed the execution of fix_aips_elcap.sh
        from $SYSMACIN to $AIPS_ROOT which will translate properly.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14848.  June 24, 2016             ALGMEM                 Eric
        If the last pass through this routine started with a model
        number greater than one but only included a single range of
        frequency channels, then the array of scaling numbers to step
        through the frequencies was not set properly.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14891.  August 25, 2016         UVLOD, FITLD            Eric
        The conversion of BASELINE to SUBARRAY was inaccurate and
        failed in some cases.  Adding roundup of 0.0001 was not
        enough, changed to 0.05.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14893.  August 26, 2016             SPLIT                 Eric
        When averaging IFs as well as channels, SPLIT got the wrong
        output frequency.  UVGET had been called so the header
        frequency was adjusted for BIF; the computation did not take
        this into account.  Use OLDFRQ instead.
        Moved to 31DEC15 this date.

14896.  August 30, 2016           UVLOD, FITLD           Eric
        Subroutine RUVTAB did not handle compressed data properly when
        DOKEEP was false.  Added a check that went over the buffer
        properly.
        Moved to 31DEC15 31 Aug.

14910.  October 6, 2010            SLICE                Eric
        The operation to drill down through a cube with a single pixel
        in X and Y and the slice running along Z had a problem if the
        X and/or Y pixel was not exactly an integer.  Bad slices
        resulted.  Corrected the code to interpolate in X and Y
        correctly during this operation.
