<h2><a name="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>We use data from the AIPS Site Surveys to assess the size and
geographical distribution of the machine power that is actively devoted to
AIPS data processing, and its growth between the surveys.  Consequences
for planning the NRAO's AIPS effort are discussed.  The main conclusions
are:

<ol>
  <li>There has been roughly three-fold growth in the average machine
      (CPU) power per user throughout the AIPS community since 1988.
      "Affordable" machine power is growing faster than the number of AIPS
      users, so we are now in a desirable growth phase in which the
      average resource per AIPS user can become a better match to the
      data-processing needs of array telescopes.<p>

  <li>The AIPS computing power is increasingly concentrated into machines
      that use large fractions of their CPU time to run AIPS &shy; the
      "share" of the computing burden borne by such "highly active" AIPS
      machines has increased, and is now almost 80% of the total.<p>

  <li>UNIX-based systems now provide 93% of the concentrated machine power
      used for AIPS data processing.  The need for long-term support of
      AIPS under VMS is now highly questionable.  The AIPS sites that
      still use VMS machines should therefore be encouraged to convert to
      UNIX as soon as possible. <p>

  <li>Most of the growth in active AIPS CPU power since 1988 has been in
      scalar RISC workstations without classical vector processors, rather
      than in vector-register machines (mini-supercomputers).  The number
      of scalar machines used for AIPS increased from 115 to 305 since
      1988, while the number of vector-register machines increased only
      from 18 to 22.  Only about a third of AIPS data processing is now
      done with the aid of classical vector hardware.  The use of
      stand-alone AP's continues to decline. <p>

  <li>The fraction of AIPS use that is devoted to VLA data processing has
      increased to 74% at the U.S. sites outside the NRAO, but continues
      to decrease at the NRAO and in other countries.  Most of the non-VLA
      use of AIPS is for other radio applications (VLB, AT, MERLIN, WSRT
      etc.).  Use of AIPS for non-radio applications continues to be about
      12% of the total. <p>

  <li>About 34% of all VLA data processing by AIPS in the U.S. is
      supported by NSF funds.  The NSF and NASA together support about 54%
      of the AIPS CPU power in the U.S.  "Local initiatives" have almost
      matched the total AIPS CPU power supported by the two main federal
      sources of funds for astronomy.  At AIPS sites with any NSF funding
      for AIPS computers, the NSF's contribution to the AIPS CPU power
      averages 70%. <p>

  <li>Computers at the NRAO now provide about 16% of the total AIPS CPU
      power devoted to VLA data processing, down from 19% in 1988.  The
      NRAO's share of all active AIPS CPU power has stabilized near
      14%.<p> 

  <li>The total AIPS machine power now in use for VLA data reduction
      around the world falls short of that needed to meet the full
      scientific potential of the VLA by a factor of about eight.  Machine
      powers in the range from high-end "compute server" workstations to
      second- or third-generation mini-supercomputers are particularly
      needed to augment the available hierarchy. 
</ol>

<h2><a name="SECT.1">1.  Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The 1990 AIPS Site Survey questionnaires were sent to 238 site managers
(Contact People &shy; CP's) whose orders of AIPS distribution tapes or
documentation suggested that AIPS might be installed at their sites.  By
the cut-off date for this report (15 March 1991), 156 CP's (66% of the
total) had responded; 74 other CP's had responded only to earlier surveys.
We therefore have some data for 230 AIPS sites (97% of the possible
total).

<p>The survey responses provide usable data on 335 computer systems on
which AIPS installations have been attempted or considered at some time.
This memo deals only with the 209 systems whose CP's reported
<em>both</em> a non-zero number of AIPS users <em>and</em> the fraction of
their CPU time that is devoted to running AIPS.  These are the computer
systems whose AIPS use is "measurable" from the Survey responses; we call
them the 209 "active" systems.  (The number of individual CPUs is 345, but
so many systems are now networked clusters or server-workstation complexes
that it is now impractical to document all CPUs separately.)  The survey
data for 204 of these active systems<a href="#N_1_">(1)</a><sup>1</sup>
are listed fully in the 1991 AIPS Site Directory (AIPS Memo No. 69).  We
therefore repeat only a few interesting subsets here.

<h2><a name="SECT.2">2. Size and Geography of the AIPS User Community</a></h2>

<p>The 209 active AIPS systems are at 142 sites in 17 countries --
Australia (6 sites), Brazil (1), Canada (9), China (4), Denmark (1),
France (5), Germany (3), Hungary (1), India (5), Israel(1), Italy (4),
Japan (2), The Netherlands (4), Spain (1), Sweden (2), the U.K. (5) and
the U.S. (88). Eighty of the active sites in the U.S. are outside the
NRAO.

<p>*"U.S." includes all non-NRAO U.S. sites.

<p>In this memo, we are interested in the distribution of the AIPS
resources both geographically and by type of operating system. Table 1
therefore summarizes the distribution of the 209 active systems (and their
users) in both "parameter spaces". The numbers in parentheses are the
numbers of AIPS users associated with the systems.

<p>The grand total of users includes some individuals more than once
because all AIPS users who reduce data at the NRAO once or more a year
<em>and</em> have AIPS systems at home are counted both at the NRAO and at
home. If (a) all NRAO visitors also had AIPS at home, and (b) no AIPS
users were counted twice elsewhere, the total of 1527 "users" would
represent about 1200 individuals.  In practice, not all NRAO users have
AIPS at home, and some will be counted more than once elsewhere. The
actual number of individual AIPS users is probably between 1200 and 1400,
and has probably grown by about 20 to 30% since 1988.

<p>Outside the NRAO, the average number of AIPS users per system is about
6.  At the NRAO, it is about 30.  This disparity reflects the large number
of VLA users who visit New Mexico and Charlottesville to reduce their data
with AIPS, and who are therefore counted in the annual user total for the
NRAO.

<p>Table 1 shows that UNIX is now the most common operating system at AIPS
sites.  Fifty-five percent of all active AIPS machines run some version of
it.  Section 3 of this report shows that VMS, despite hosting 44% of all
systems that now run AIPS (92 systems), now hosts only 6% of the total
<em>machine power</em> devoted to AIPS.  The role of VMS in the AIPS
community has diminished steadily since the 1986 site survey.  Section 5
looks at the growth history of the AIPS community in detail.

<h2><a name="SECT.3">3. Machine Power Devoted to AIPS</a></h2>

<p>To estimate the total machine power devoted to AIPS processing
worldwide, we asked each CP to list for each machine the CPU type, array
processor (AP) type, if any, and the fraction of its CPU use that is
devoted to AIPS processing.  We then assigned every machine an "AIPS
weight" <em>AIPSWT</em> that estimates the average "horsepower", in
(VAX780 + FPS120B AP) full-time equivalents, that is in use for AIPS
computations on that machine.  For each individual computer,
<em>AIPSWT</em> is the product of a generic "machine weight" <em>MWT</em>
and its CP's estimate of the fraction of the machine's time that is
devoted to AIPS processing.

<p>Table 2 lists the "machine weights" <em>MWT</em> assigned to different
CPU and AP combinations for this memo.  They range from 0.1 to 40 for the
least and most powerful machines actively running AIPS.  The "VAX780+AP"
unit, which has normalized this comparison since 1985, is therefore still
an appropriate choice even though the VAX780+AP combination itself is
almost extinct.

<p>We have incorporated recent AIPS benchmarking results (see Appendix B
for details) into Table 2.  Because the performance of AIPS in Convex
C-1's and in some other machines has recently been improved (by code
optimization), some of the machine weights used in this version of the
table differ in detail from those assigned to the same CPUs in earlier
AIPS Site Surveys.

<p>The "machine weights" in Table 2 are based on a mix of scalar and
vector performance, calibrated by timings from the AIPS medium DDT test
for a small but representative sample of machines (Appendix B).  We base
our scale on the medium DDT test because it is the only part of the DDT
suite that can be run in reasonable times on the entire range of machines:
the large test takes too long on the least powerful machines and the small
test takes too little time on the most powerful ones.  We do not have
access to DDT timing data for many types of machine.  For these, we have
estimated <em>MWT</em> by scaling from the DDT timings of roughly
comparable machines, using either the manufacturers' own product
comparisons or published LINPACK benchmarks.

<p>The actual throughput of a machine also depends on disk configuration
and space, on the number of simultaneous users, on the mixture of AIPS
tasks that is used, and other factors. The "machine weights" are therefore
but rough estimates of relative AIPS performance, and may differ from
machine rankings that apply to other code. If any Site Managers believe
that the actual AIPS performance of their machine is seriously
misrepresented in Table 2, please send us your medium DDT timings so that
we can update and correct this table.

<p>Appendix A lists the equivalent full-time (VAX780+AP)'s devoted to AIPS
at 142 "active" AIPS sites whose CP's gave us permission to publish their
data. The table lists includes 204 computer systems, alphabetically by
institute and by country. <em>MWT</em> is the machine weight from Table 2.
<em>AIPSWT</em> is <em>MWT</em> times the fraction of the machine's time
that is devoted to AIPS; <em>AIPSWT</em> thus measures the equivalent
full-time CPU power devoted to AIPS on the machine (treating an AP as part
of the "CPU" here). <em>#U</em> is the number of AIPS users (the annual
totals given by the Site Managers for their site as a whole have been
distributed across their active machines in proportion to the machine
weights), and <em>DISK</em> is the AIPS disk space in
Gbytes. <em>AV.WT</em> indicates the average "resource per active AIPS
user", obtained by multiplying the machine weight <em>MWT</em> by the AIPS
disk space in Gbytes and dividing by the average number of simultaneous
AIPS users on the machine. Thus, <em>AV.WT</em> = 1 for a machine that
provides its average active AIPS user with the computing power of a
(VAX780+AP), and 1 Gbyte of disk space, regardless of how much of the
machine's time is actually used for AIPS.  (Factors such as disk space
relative to the size of the typical problem, other use of the machine,
presence of a TV or laser printer, on-site AIPS and systems expertise,
also affect a site's ability to service its AIPS users, but are hard to
quantify.)

<p>Table 3 gives the distribution of equivalent full-time machine power
that is in use for AIPS at all 145 "active" sites, by geographical area
and by operating system, in (VAX780+AP) units.

<p>The following aspects of Appendix A and Table 3 are noteworthy:

<DL COMPACT>
  <DT> a) <DD> Experience with AIPS in Cray X-MP single processors under
      the COS operating system suggests a weight of 25 for such machines
      (when running AIPS).  The total machine power devoted to running
      AIPS (summing all active AIPS sites) is thus equivalent to about 6.5
      Cray X-MP processors running full-time, or about 40 Convex C-1's
      running full-time.<P>

  <DT> b) <DD> The machine power in use for AIPS under VMS is now only 6%
      of the total, down from 20% in 1988 and 29% in 1986.  Nearly all of
      the most powerful machines now running AIPS have vector register or
      fast RISC architectures, but there is no comparable VMS
      machine. Many of the VMS machines that are now running at AIPS sites
      are AP-less MicroVAXes. There are still 33 such machines in active
      use for AIPS (15 outside the U.S., 18 inside) but they represent
      only 2.2% of the total machine power that is in use for AIPS. <P>

    </DL><P>

  <DT> c) <DD>86% of the documented machine power devoted to AIPS is now
      outside the NRAO, i.e. there is a little over six times as much
      machine power devoted to AIPS use outside the NRAO as there is
      inside. The AIPS machine power in the U.S. outside the NRAO is now
      about 3.2 times that inside the NRAO. <P>

  <DT> d) <DD>The distribution of the machine power that is in use for
      AIPS differs significantly from that of the AIPS users, as Figure 1
      emphasizes. The Figure shows the cumulative distributions of
      <em>AIPSWT</em>, of the users and of <em>MWT</em>, normalized to
      their respective totals of 164.7 (VAX780+AP)'s, 1527 users and 521.4
      (VAX780+AP)'s. (Note that the last figure is the equivalent of about
      21 Cray X-MP processors running full-time.  This would be the total
      machine power available to AIPS if all AIPS users world-wide could
      achieve a local <em>coup d'etat</em> that gave them exclusive access
      to their machines!).  Figure 1 plots the 209 active systems in order
      of increasing <em>AIPSWT</em> from left to right. Large
      machine-to-machine variations in computing power, in their
      utilization for AIPS, and in the number of AIPS users, make these
      plots non-linear.
</DL>

<p> The curves for <em>USERS</em> and <em>MWT</em> are similar, i.e. the
overall machine power <em>MWT</em> is generally distributed quite like the
users.  This presumably reflects economics in the sense that funding for
computing resources is distributed roughly in the same manner as the
number of users. <em>AIPSWT</em>, the machine power that is <em>in use for
AIPS</em>, is much more concentrated to a subset of the machines that are
substantially dedicated to AIPS, however.  For example, Figure 1 shows
that 50% of the AIPS machine power comes from 19 systems that service
almost 40% of all AIPS users; 90% of the AIPS machine power comes from 73
systems that service about 61% of the users.  Although these distributions
are slightly more egalitarian than those of two years ago (when 50% of the
machine power was contributed by just 10 systems servicing 37% of the
users) they still show that most of the AIPS machine power is concentrated
to a subset of less than half of the AIPS sites.  The next section
therefore looks at the distribution of AIPS machine power per AIPS user in
detail.

<p>Table 4 shows how different "countries" (again separating the NRAO from
the rest of the U.S.) rank when the total machine power devoted to AIPS is
normalized by the total number of AIPS users in the country.  Although
many other factors influence each site's ability to service its AIPS users
(and one other is examined below) high ratios of <em>AIPSWT/User</em> in
these tables are more desirable than low values.  The ranking by
<em>AIPSWT/User</em> can be thought of as measuring the ability to perform
a given number of computations with AIPS per user, averaged annually over
all AIPS users in the country.  High values of <em>AIPSWT/User</em> give a
potential for high throughput per user, or for efficient use of
astronomers' AIPS time.  Low values imply low productivity, or excessive
contention for AIPS time, for the average user.

<p>Comparing Table 4 with the corresponding table from 1988 shows that the
<em>AIPSWT/User</em> ratio at the NRAO has increased by a factor of about
4.5.  The numbers of AIPS users at non-NRAO sites has increased slightly
in the U.S. and outside (from 481 to 604 and from 417 to 468
respectively), but the machine power devoted to AIPS has increased much
faster, so that the <em>average AIPSWT/User</em> at the non-NRAO sites has
roughly tripled in the past two years, much as it did in the previous
two-year period.  Despite these improvements, the average
<em>AIPSWT/User</em> in the U.S. remains modest relative to that in many
countries with active astronomical communities, particularly The
Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. The non-NRAO sites in the U.S. rank
eighth, and the NRAO twelfth, in this country-by-country comparison, as
they did in 1988.  So, although the average AIPS machine power per user at
non-NRAO U.S. sites has increased by almost a factor of ten since the end
of 1986 (when it was 0.0126), <em>more substantial gains have been made
elsewhere</em>, most notably in Sweden, Australia and The Netherlands.
The average machine power per user in the U.S. should increase again by a
factor between 2 and 3, and at the NRAO by a factor between 6 and 10, to
reach competitive levels.

<p>Other notable changes in Table 4 since 1988 are (1) the arrival of a
Convex C-220 and several major workstations at Leiden, increasing the AIPS
CPU power per user there by a factor of six and so moving the Dutch
average to the top of this Table, (2) a major increase in the AIPS machine
power per user in China, where the acquisition of workstations has
outraced the addition of new AIPS users.

<p>Table 4 emphasizes the average "CPU" power that is available to each
country's entire AIPS user community --- a "global" measure. It is also
important to look at how well individual machines can support AIPS users
while they are actually computing (i.e., at how well each machine
<em>concentrates</em> resources on an individual user's problem for the
fraction of time that the user has access to it). The average fractional
use of the machines for AIPS is the ratio of the total worldwide
<em>AIPSWT</em> (164.7) to the total <em>MWT</em> (515.4), or about
one-third, close to its value in 1988. Of the 209 "active" systems, 75
(36%) reported that more than one-third of their CPU time is dedicated to
AIPS (both the proportion and the number of such systems has increased
since 1988, when the corresponding values were 48 machines and 31%). These
75 "highly active" AIPS systems account for 79% of the total machine power
that is used for AIPS (up from 69% in 1988), and for 75% of the machine
power that is used for VLA-related AIPS work (up from 58% in 1988).  We
therefore use these 75 systems to assess the distribution of "concentrated
AIPS power".

<p>Of the 75 "highly active" systems, 48 are in the U.S., including 9 at
the NRAO.  The fraction of these machines that is in the U.S. is almost
identical to that in 1988.  The 27 "highly active" AIPS machines outside
the U.S. are distributed as follows: 7 in Australia, 5 in each of Canada
and The Netherlands, 3 in China, 2 in the U.K. and 1 in each of Germany,
India, Italy, Japan and Sweden.  The Australian, Dutch and Chinese
representation in this group has grown faster than that of other countries
since 1988.

<p>Of the 75 "highly active" systems, 62 run under UNIX, 12 under VMS and
1 (Fujitsu) under another OS.  The concentration of machine power to UNIX
among these systems is much more dramatic than the machine count, however
--- 93% of the AIPS machine power in these highly active AIPS machines is
now UNIX-based.

</DIV>

<p>Table 5 lists the "top twenty" among these machines, in decreasing
order of <em>AV.WT</em>, a measure of the average AIPS resource per
simultaneous AIPS user.  (<em>AV.WT</em> is the machine or cluster weight
<em>MWT</em> times AIPS disk space <em>DISK</em> in Gbytes, divided by the
average number of simultaneous AIPS users at times when the machine is
being used for AIPS and (in clusters) divided further by the number of
machines in the cluster).  The normalization for clusters accounts for the
fact that no one AIPS computation can, at present, be distributed across
all machines in the cluster.

<p> The twenty systems listed in Table 5 are where the largest AIPS
resources (in terms of computing power and disk space together) are
available to individual users <em>while they are actually running
AIPS</em> on these "highly active" machines. The maximum resource that can
be concentrated on any project by a single computer is measured by
<em>MWT*DISK,</em> which is usually greater than <em>AV.WT</em>.  If,
however, an AIPS site allows more users to have data on disk than are
simultaneously running tasks, the average resource per <em>active</em>
user can be less than <em>AV.WT</em>.  <em>AV.WT</em> is thus a reasonable
measure of the average computing resource per active AIPS user for many
sites.

<p> The proportion of U.S. machines in Table 5 (64%) is the same it was in
the "top ten" from 1988.  The domination by UNIX systems also continues.
Table 5's view of the most concentrated AIPS resources differs in one
significant respect from the "top ten" of 1988, however.  Only about half
of the systems in Table 5 use vector registers, and powerful scalar RISC
workstations (or clusters of such workstations) with moderate disk
resources now dominate the table at <em>AV.WT</em> &lt; 3.

<p> Even these "top twenty" machines provide modest values of
<em>AV.WT</em> relative to many radio astronomical data processing needs,
especially those of VLA spectral line observing. Individual projects often
need about 1 Gbyte of disk storage for reductions that take several days
of CPU time in a machine with <em>MWT</em>=4 or 5. It is therefore an
indication of the overall underfunding of VLA data processing around the
world that still only 6 sites have systems with <em>AV.WT</em> &gt;= 4.4,
the equivalent for a single user of a Convex C-1/XP with 1 Gbyte of disk
for AIPS data.  The disparity of funding from site to site is evidenced by
the fact that two of these six sites each have two such machines.  The
relatively low cost of the most powerful RISC workstations could soon
transform this picture, however, if sites that obtain such machines also
couple them to many-Gbyte disk systems at high I/O bandwidth.

<h2><a name="SECT.5">5. Growth Rates</a></h2>

<p> Table 6 shows the growth of several measures of worldwide AIPS use
from the end of 1986 to the end of 1990. The highest growth rates in AIPS
CPU use were again at the non-NRAO U.S. sites (see Figure 2), particularly
for VLA data reduction, for which the 1988-to-1990 increase was almost
twice the NRAO's 1990 capacity.  The machine power devoted to AIPS inside
the NRAO has grown at exactly the worldwide average rate since 1988, after
several years of zero growth<a href="#N_2_">(2)</a><sup>2</sup>.  The use
of AIPS for non-VLA radio work has grown especially rapidly at the NRAO,
due to an increased emphasis on AIPS use for VLBI code development and
data processing.  AIPS CPU use for non-radio applications has grown
rapidly outside the U.S.

<p> Some noteworthy trends exhibited by Table 6 are:

<H3>A. <a name="SECT.5.A">AIPS use devoted to VLA processing</a></H3>

Sixty-one per cent of worldwide AIPS use is currently devoted to
processing VLA data.  This fraction has increased slightly from 56% in
1988 and 46% in 1986 (see Table 6 and Figure 3).  Within this overall
trend there are some important details, which we now discuss. <p>

<p> First, although the machine power devoted to VLA data processing at
the NRAO tripled since 1988, it also fell to its lowest "share" ever of
the worldwide total (16%, see Figure 4).  This is because the AIPS machine
power used for VLA data processing at other sites in the U.S. grew much
faster, more than quadrupling since 1988.  This shifting of the VLA data
reduction burden in the U.S. from the NRAO to its users has had advantages
for the users.  These include: the ability to work on their VLA data when
it is convenient to do so without traveling to the NRAO, and increased
year-round involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in VLA data
processing at their home institutions.

<p> Second, the fraction of the NRAO's AIPS use that is devoted to VLA
data processing has fallen to 70% from a high of 92% in 1986.  This
reflects an increase in the use of AIPS at the NRAO for VLBI data
processing and VLBA code development (and to a lesser extent for
single-dish data processing).  Previous site surveys had shown a similar
decrease in emphasis on VLA data reduction at other U.S. AIPS sites, but
this trend has now reversed: the fraction of all AIPS CPU use that is
devoted to VLA data reduction at other U.S. sites grew to 74% in 1990 from
a low of 65% in 1988.  This may have come about because AIPS can now be
used to calibrate VLA data at users' home installations.

<p> Third, the uses of AIPS for different types of data reduction are
significantly different inside and outside the U.S.  The fraction of
non-U.S.  AIPS use that is devoted to VLA data processing is only 44%.
This lower emphasis on VLA data processing in other countries reflects
their greater use of AIPS to reduce data from other radio telescopes,
particularly in Australia, Holland and the U.K.  Use of AIPS outside the
U.S. to process non-radio data is also increasing more rapidly than it is
inside the U.S.

<H3>B. <a name="SECT.5.B">The array processor</a> --- almost extinct</H3>

<p> The fraction of the active AIPS machine power represented by systems
with separate AP's has declined from 55% in 1985 to 2.6% in 1990, and the
absolute machine power contributed by them has also declined.  The AP
microcode for AIPS has been frozen for several years and will remain so,
absent new hardware developments that might revitalize this almost-extinct
AIPS architecture.

<p><img src="AIPSMEMO70.WP.html.htg/NUMVECT.PCX.gif" width="448" height="460" align="right" >

<H3>C. <a name="SECT.5.C">"Naked scalar machines"</a> --- the recent growth path</H3>

<p> In the 1988 survey, 75% of all AIPS installations had no
vector-register hardware.  Such "naked scalar machines" were important to
the AIPS community then for two reasons --- Sun-3 workstations and
MicroVAXes had low entry level costs, and they offered AIPS users a large
and <em>predictable</em> share of their resources.  These two factors made
naked scalar machines attractive in 1988 even though many of them could
not then handle the more computationally-intensive AIPS data reductions in
reasonable times.  The last two years have seen large increases in the
machine power available at modest cost in naked scalar machines, so their
importance to AIPS users has grown rapidly (see Figure 5).  The less
powerful machines are often used as personal workstations attached to a
hierarchical network that includes more powerful processors.

<p> The naked scalar machine count was dominated in 1988 by MicroVAXes and
Sun-3 workstations.  It is now dominated by Sun-4 workstations,
particularly SPARC stations, with a few powerful DECstations and IBM
workstations also evident.  The 1990 data show 32 Sun-3's in active use
for AIPS (up from 22 in 1988, but most of these are now in networks with
more powerful partners or servers rather than stand-alone systems).  There
are now at least 115 Sun-4's in active use for AIPS (compared with only
one in 1988).  Many of these new Sun-4's are in clusters or networks.
Fortunately, there are now several Sun-4's in use for AIPS at the NRAO, so
the AIPS group can test AIPS installation and performance on these
systems.  The advent of even more powerful "superscalar" RISC workstations
from vendors such as IBM and HP/Apollo suggests that this architecture is
likely to play an important role in serving AIPS data processing in the
future.

<p> In sharp contrast to the above, the total number of MicroVAXes being
actively used for AIPS fell from 41 to 33 between 1988 and 1990<a
href="#N_3_">(3)</a><sup>3</sup>.

<h2><a name="SECT.6">6. Memory and Disk Resources</a></h2>

<p> The mean memory size on active AIPS machines has increased from 7.7
Mbytes in 1985 to 21.6 Mbytes in 1990; 87% of all active AIPS machines now
have 8 or more Mbytes of memory, and 49% have 16 or more Mbytes of memory.
Seven active AIPS machines (six of which are in the U.S.) have more than
64 Mbytes of memory.  Although some of these increased memory resources
are consumed by operating systems, an increasing fraction of all AIPS
sites can take advantage of the options in AIPS to use larger memory
resources, e.g., for sort-less imaging.

<p> The total disk space available for AIPS worldwide is now about 217
Gbytes, up significantly from 124 Gbytes in 1990.  Although this increase
is not as dramatic as the increase in CPU power, the average disk space
available per <em>simultaneously active</em> AIPS user has increased
significantly.  It rose from 0.6 Gbytes in 1988 to 0.9 Gbytes in 1990.  In
1988, there was a significant difference in the average disk space per
active user between U.S. sites outside the NRAO (0.73 Gbytes per user),
and at non-U.S. sites (0.48 Gbytes per user).  This disparity between the
average disk space per user in the U.S.  and elsewhere is disappearing ---
the corresponding 1990 data are 0.97 Gbytes per user and 0.88 Gbytes per
user respectively.  The NRAO systems have only 0.74 Gbytes per
simultaneous user on average, but several of these machines are used more
for code development than for routine data processing, so this difference
may not be significant.

<p> We note, however, that individual VLA data reduction projects may need
1 Gbyte of disk for reductions that take several days of CPU time machines
such as first-generation mini-supercomputers or powerful RISC workstations
with "machine weights" of 3 to 5.  AIPS managers supporting active VLA
users at sites with much less than 1 Gbyte of disk space per active user
may wish to emphasize this benchmark, as well as the trends elsewhere,
when justifying new disk resources!

<h2><a name="SECT.7">7. Tape Systems</a></h2>

<p> By far the most common tape format available on active AIPS systems is
6250 bpi (128 systems), followed by 1600 bpi (118 systems -- 61 systems
have both 6250 and 1600 bpi).  Many of the new UNIX workstations have
direct access only to smaller tape formats, however.  Of these, Exabyte is
the most common (43 systems), followed by QIC24 (27 systems) and QIC150
(11 systems).  All other formats are much less common<a
href="#N_4_">(4)</a><sup>4</sup>. The options presently offered by the
NRAO for its AIPS distribution tapes (6250, 1600 and Exabyte) match the
most popular tape formats at AIPS sites well.

<p> As high-bandwidth transfers over the InterNet are now possible to many
AIPS sites, more sites are acquiring the AIPS software by anonymous-ftp.
The export of moderate-sized data sets from the VLA by ftp is also
becoming routine.  Tape compatibility with the NRAO for software or data
distribution may therefore be less important in the next few years.

<h2><a name="SECT.8">8. Other Image Processing Packages at AIPS Sites</a></h2>

<p> We asked each CP what other image processing packages are used at
their site. In all, 56 different software packages were identified, 46 by
name and 10 as "local code".  Thirteen of the named packages are used at
more than two AIPS sites. They are: IRAF (57 sites), MIDAS (12), CalTech
VLBI (11), IDL (10), VISTA (7), FIGARO (5), STSDAS (5), Starlink (4),
GIPSY (4), DAOPHOT (4), GILDAS (3), NCSA (3), COMB (3).

<p> The greatest "user overlap" between AIPS and other image processing
systems is therefore with the same packages as in 1988.  The overlap with
IRAF is large but is no longer increasing much (there were 55 common sites
in 1988).  The overlap with MIDAS has decreased slightly (there were 16
common sites in 1988).  The overlap with the CalTech VLBI package, with
VISTA and with DAOPHOT have all increased but remain small. Plans to
increase compatibility between AIPS and other image processing packages
would be of greatest benefit if they began with IRAF, MIDAS, the CalTech
VLBI package and IDL.

<p> IRAF and MIDAS are also the most common imaging processing systems at
sites that have received AIPS kits but do not currently have AIPS
installed (seven such sites use IRAF, three use MIDAS).

<h2><a name="SECT.9">9. Network Connections</a></h2>

<p> Network connections among the non-NRAO AIPS sites continue to grow
rapidly.  Forty-four per cent of the active AIPS sites have InterNet
service, 42% have BitNet service, 35% have SPAN or HEPNet service, and 92%
have service on at least one net.  This connectivity should allow sites to
help each other better with AIPS problems that involve interfaces or
peripherals that the NRAO cannot duplicate.

<h2><a name="SECT.10">10. Non-radio Use of AIPS</a></h2>

<p> Fifty-seven sites report using AIPS for some applications in optical
astronomy, and 38 for some applications in infrared astronomy.  These
numbers are virtually unchanged from 1988.  Twenty-two sites use AIPS more
for non-radio applications than for radio astronomy, and 13 use it
exclusively for non-radio applications.  Of these 13 "exclusively
non-radio" AIPS sites, 3 use AIPS only for optical astronomy, 2 use it
only for infrared astronomy, and the others use it for multi-wavelength or
biomedical imaging.  Five of these sites report that their AIPS activity
takes 10% or more of their available CPU time, and one (used for optical
and X-ray astronomy) is almost a dedicated AIPS machine, with 95% CPU use
for AIPS.

<p> The use of AIPS in non-radio applications is growing at about the same
overall rate as that for all radio applications (see Table 6 and Figure
3).  It remains about 12% of the use of AIPS for VLA data processing, for
example.  The growth of AIPS use for non-radio work has recently been
greatest outside the U.S. (see Table 6).  We note however that all but one
of the sites at which AIPS is used exclusively for non-radio data
processing are in the U.S.

<p> Given the large number of image-processing packages that are
specifically targeted to the needs of astronomy at other wavelengths, the
NRAO has not made any special effort to enhance or promote the non-radio
uses of AIPS.  It is not surprising, however, that many sites acquire and
use AIPS primarily for radio astronomy applications but also use it for
other purposes.  Many of the AIPS image-analysis tasks are intrinsically
general. AIPS also has built-in support for multiple coordinate systems
and projections.  Users are (for better or worse) familiar with the
command structure and capabilities of AIPS.  AIPS code also takes a
significant fraction of the available program disk space on many
machines. Some spin-off to other uses is to be expected for all of these
reasons.  Further development of AIPS should therefore recognize that the
package has a small but significant role to play for non-radio
applications, which should be preserved whenever it is possible do so at
an equally small cost in resources.

<h2><a name="SECT.11">11. Funding</a></h2>

<H3>A. <a name="SECT.11.A">The role of the NSF and NASA</a></H3>

<p> For the first time, this year's survey asked AIPS Site managers what
fractions of their site's computing funds come from the NSF and from NASA.
Forty-one of the 116 active non-NRAO AIPS sites in the U.S. have some NSF
computer funding, while 41 of the same 116 sites have some NASA computer
funding.  Eighteen sites have some funding from both NSF and NASA.  Thus,
63 U.S. non-NRAO sites have either some NSF funding or some NASA funding,
and 53 are funded entirely from other sources.

<p> At the 41 "NSF-funded" sites outside the NRAO, the NSF contribution
accounts on average for 70% of the AIPS computing power.  At the 41
"NASA-funded" sites, the NASA contribution accounts on average for 63% of
the AIPS computing power. The two agencies together have provided about
54% of the AIPS computing power in the U.S. outside the NRAO (25% from the
NSF, 29% from NASA).

<H3>B. <a name="SECT.11.B">The role of "local initiatives"</a></H3>

<p> "Local initiatives" have supplied the remaining 46% of the CPU power
that is used for AIPS in the U.S.  These initiatives are also the sole
source of support at 46% by number of all non-NRAO AIPS sites in the U.S.,
and contribute about 30% of the computing power at the sites that do have
NSF or NASA support.

<p> At the NRAO, 62% of the AIPS computing power is NSF-funded, the rest
coming mainly from equipment loaned to the observatory by manufacturers.
The NRAO therefore had a slightly smaller-than-average NSF contribution
for an NSF-funded site at the end of 1990.

<H3>C. <a name="SECT.11.C">VLA data processing</a></H3>

<p> The above totals are drawn from all AIPS applications, regardless of
sub-field.  As the VLA operation is primarily funded by the NSF, it is
also interesting to examine what fraction of VLA data processing is
supported by NSF funds.  The total VLA-related AIPS use at the NRAO is the
equivalent of 16.0 VAX780+AP's running full-time, while that at other
U.S. sites is the equivalent of 54.5 such machines.  Of these totals, 11.4
and 12.5 (71% and 23% respectively) are NSF-funded.  Thus, the
NSF-supported VLA data reduction is roughly equally divided between
machines at the NRAO and machines at users' home institutions.  The
worldwide machine weight devoted to VLA data processing is 101 VAX780+AP
units, while the total of NSF-supported VLA data processing is 23.9 units.
NSF funds support about 34% of all VLA data processing now done in the
U.S., or 24% of the global total.

<h2><a name="SECT.12">12. Discussion</a></h2>

<p> The distribution of AIPS outside the NRAO multiplies the total machine
power used for VLA data reduction under AIPS by a factor of six.  (It also
supports about two-thirds of this external resource again for other
imaging applications -- mainly, but not exclusively, at radio
wavelengths.)  Much of this AIPS machine power is funded by neither the
NSF nor NASA. but by "local initiatives".  The fraction of VLA data that
is processed outside the NRAO machines continues to grow, but at a slower
rate than it did in the late 1980's.

<p> The total machine power available to the AIPS users around the world
has approximately tripled in the last two years, and has outstripped the
growth in the number of sites and number of users.  The community has
therefore entered a desirable growth phase in which the available AIPS CPU
power per user is increasing significantly.

<P>Even the large aggregate machine power -- the equivalent of about 6
Cray X/MP processors running full-time -- that is now in harness for AIPS
is much less than the total machine power required for timely VLA and VLBA
data reduction, as estimated in the NRAO's February 1989 Array Telescope
Computing Plan.  The total machine power that is presently in use for AIPS
is only about one-eighth of what would be needed to process all VLA and
VLBA data in AIPS without "choking off" the research done with these
instruments purely to meet off-line computing restrictions.  In this
survey's units, the VLA science requires a full-time MWT of 791, and the
VLBA science a full-time MWT of 393, if data reduction is to keep pace
with the desirable mix of observations.  The total of 165
(VAX780+AP)-equivalents (or about 37 Convex C-1/XP equivalents) that is
now in use for AIPS worldwide is therefore about one-seventh of the total
needed to process the full range of desirable scientific observations from
the VLA and VLBA.  (If we consider only the VLA, the total machine weight
of 101 that is in effective full-time use for data processing under AIPS
is about one-eighth of what is desirable.)

<p><strong>Figure 6 </strong>Required and Achieved Machine Power
Distributions
</div>

<P>Continued massive growth in machine power (both CPU power and disk
storage) per site, and efficient code, will therefore be needed to meet
the needs of the radio astronomical community in the 1990's.  What sorts
of computer can best make up for the present eight-fold deficiency for VLA
and VLBA data processing?

<P>Figure 6 illustrates the difference between an "ideal hierarchy" of
computer power for VLA/VLBA data processing and the mixture of powers that
is currently achieved according to this survey.  We have here defined the
"ideal hierarchy" to be one in which every major class of VLA and VLBA
observing program is served by its own dedicated machines, and that these
machines can process a year's accumulation of data from that class of
program in a year of computing time (allowing for the "share" of the total
observing that is devoted to that class).  For each major class, we
estimated both the fraction of VLA and VLBA observing time devoted to that
class and the CPU power needed to keep pace with this rate of observing in
"real time", i.e. to reduce a year's share of that type of observing in a
year of computer time.  The solid line in Figure 6 shows the computer
hierarchy that would be "ideally matched" to the scientific demand
(without regard for actual computer architectures), if machines of the
required powers made up the same fraction of the total CPU power as the
corresponding observations do of the total observing time.  The full line
is, in this sense, the "desirable" distribution of computing power for VLA
and VLBA data processing.

<P>The dotted line in Figure 6 shows the distribution of machine powers
now accessible to AIPS users, according to this Site Survey.  The peak
near <em>MWT</em> = 2 reflects the relative abundance of the most
affordable RISC workstations.  The accessible machines are not exclusively
used for AIPS, however.  The dashed-and-dotted line shows the distribution
of effective machine powers in full-time use for AIPS data processing.
This distribution skews toward lower effective machine powers because of
time-sharing with other applications.  Where the dashed-and-dotted line is
above the full line, there is an over-abundance of realized machine power
in the AIPS community relative to the "ideal hierarchy".  Relatively more
machine power is needed wherever the full line is above the
dashed-and-dotted line, and particularly the range 10 &lt; <em>MWT</em>
&lt; 200.

<P>Figure 6 shows that the needs of the less-computer intensive VLA and
VLBA data reduction are being met relatively well by the installed base of
RISC workstations and first-generation mini-supercomputers.  Further
acquisitions of machines in these classes will therefore be driven more by
geographical needs ("an AIPS workstation near every user") than by
total-load requirements ("the right global mix of computers for the
VLA/VLBA mix of science").  Acquisition of machines with <em>MWT</em> from
10 to 200 will, however, move the overall shape of the machine power
distribution closer to that needed by the full range of VLA and VLBA
scientific applications.  The lower part of this range of machine powers
is populated by higher-end "superscalar" workstations and servers.  The
higher part now corresponds to second- or third-generation
mini-supercomputers with multiple processors.  It is therefore to be hoped
that future computer acquisitions at major AIPS sites will balance an
improved geographic distribution of inexpensive workstations with the
acquisition of some machines in the range 10 &lt; <em>MWT</em> &lt; 200
(roughly 2.5 to 50 times a Convex C-1/XP).

<P>This survey clearly corroborates several trends that were noticed in
the previous (1988) survey.  Of these, the most important is that most of
the recent growth in AIPS machine power is based on inexpensive UNIX-based
workstations.  As the "mini-supercomputers" that contribute most of the
remaining machine power are also UNIX-based, it is now highly questionable
whether it is worth continuing to update AIPS to the VMS sites which
contribute only about 7% of the total machine power.  (There are still 92
VMS-based systems in use for AIPS worldwide, but only 12 of these devote
more than 1/3 of their CPU use to AIPS).  As the remaining VMS machines at
the NRAO are being phased out, AIPS code will no longer be exercised under
VMS at the observatory.  Furthermore, little new code will be added to the
existing AIPS package pending a planned major revision to AIPS.  It may
therefore now be quite appropriate, and create relatively little hardship,
to freeze the VMS version of AIPS.

<P>The scale on which UNIX-based vector-register machines and workstations
have won acceptance at AIPS sites meshes well with the development path
that is visualized in the NRAO's Array Telescope Computing Plan.  This
plan also called for the use of some supercomputer time to handle the most
demanding VLA and VLBA data reductions.  We note that the present AIPS
Site Survey is the first to report a "supercomputer" (Cray X/MP) in
routine use anywhere for AIPS data processing.  It is now fairly
straightforward to bring up AIPS under UNIX at supercomputer centers where
there is local interest in astronomical data processing.  The need for a
separate "supercomputer strategy" for AIPS has effectively been eliminated
by this, and by the appearance of high-performance UNIX-based
mini-supercomputers and powerful workstations at moderate costs.

<H2><a name="APDX.B">Appendix B. </a>DDT Test Results and Machine Weights</H2>

<P>Tables B1 and B2 list the AIPS medium DDT trials that have been used to
estimate the machine weights <em>MWT</em> throughout this memo.  The CPU times
in seconds have been normalized to weights of 3.5 for the Convex C-1/XP as of
January 1989.  Separate ratings for the scalar and vector performance of the
machines are then reweighted in a 1:4 ratio to determine the overall machine
weight.  Table B1 gives the results for "mainframes", Table B2 for
"workstations".  The normalizing results for the C-1/XP in January 1989 are
given in both tables.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a><sup>1</sup> The CP's of 5 systems asked us not to
publish their detailed data.  The data for their systems are included in our
statistical summaries, however.

<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a><sup>2</sup> This parity of growth at the NRAO is due
largely to the acquisition of the "Yucca" Convex C-1 at the AOC and to
manufacturers' loans of the "Lemur" IBM 530 and "Colobus" DECstation 3100
workstations to Charlottesville.

<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a><sup>3</sup> The 1988 AIPS Site Survey anticipated
this decline of the MicroVaxes, as it showed that 6 sites had abandoned use of
MicroVaxes as AIPS processors even though 16 other sites had purchased them
since 1987.

<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a><sup>4</sup> We note, however, that the CP's of 41
systems provided no information about their tape systems.  Many of these may
not have access to tape, but it is also possible that the survey's sampling of
tape options is unusually incomplete.
