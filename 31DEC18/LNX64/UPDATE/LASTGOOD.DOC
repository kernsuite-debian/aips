                 Changes while 31DEC18 is TST

***********************************************************************
***********************************************************************

15103.  December 11, 2017         Version update               Eric
        Changed $APLSUB/GETRLS.FOR. $INSUNIX/INSTEP1,
        $SYSPERL/install.pl, $SYSPERL/update.pl, $SYSPERL/ZXHLP2.PL,
        $SYSPERL/LaCook.PL, $UPDUNIX/UPDCONTROL,
        $SYSUNIX/AIPSPATH.CSH, $SYSUNIX/AIPSPATH.SH
        to make 31DEC18 instead of 31DEC17 - also fix dates in
        install.pl.
        Moved nowhere.

15104.  December 14, 2017          UVHOL                Eric
        Corrected DATPOL version in UVHOL for correct call sequences
        to LXPOL and friends.  Added APARM(10) option to apply the
        normal parallactic angle correction, default is not to do it.
        Changed OPTIMIZE.LIS to not optimize this task.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15105.  December 15, 2017          HOLOG                Eric
        Added adverb REFREQ to give the reference frequency for the
        image spacing and DOVECT to choose between amplitude/phase and
        real/imaginary.
        In Fortran added arrays for real and imaginary.  Changed U/V
        coordinate labels to L/M.  Changed GRID to fill in real and
        imaginary and blank them.  Changed to honor DOVECT for
        real/imaginary when requested.  Try to pick up the Stokes from
        the INFILE name and if found add a Stokes axis to the output
        images.  Use REFREQ to scale images but save the actual
        frequency to put in the headers.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15106.  December 18, 2017           ANINI               Eric
        AN tables may need NIF keywords plus the 22 or so that occur
        always - PCAL requires this.  Changed ANINI to ask for this
        many keywords - others IF 30 led to PCAL failing.
        Moved to 31DEC17 December 15.

15107.  December 18, 2017              PCNTR             Eric
        Changed it to draw vectors even when the axes are not a
        position pair - with a warning.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15108.  December 18, 2017            COMB               Eric
        Changed to set Stokes to Q, U, or V when doing ratio with I
        image.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15109.  December 20, 2017         TVFLG, SPFLG          Eric
        Changed TVFLG, SPFLG, FTFLG, GRIDTB.FOR to support STOKES =
        'IQU' and 'IQUV'
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15110.  December 21, 2017            PCNTR              Eric
        For the special case of axes = 'L' and 'M' with a positive
        increment for L, change the sign of the plotted polarization
        angle.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15111.  December 21, 2017            HOLOG              Eric
        changed to get the Stokes from the data file - using the file
        name depends too much on the user.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15112.  January 2, 2018          VLANT files             Eric
        Created the $AIPSTARS file EVLA.ant.2017 from the web location
        maintained for the EVLA and the dummy file VLA.ant.2018 to
        handle very old data.
        Moved everywhere.

15113.  January 2, 2018            DXYGET               Eric
        The subroutine to change linear polarization into true Stokes
        had addressing errors that caused the output to compress all
        flagged channels.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15114.  January 3, 2018              RLDIF              Eric
        Changed the matrix print routine to make a nicer output on
        DOPRINT < -2.5.
        Moved nowhere.

15115.  January 9, 2018          linear polarization       Eric
        The parallactic angle correction done for circulars must not
        be done for linears.  We do it later in DXYGET when converting
        to Stokes.  Changed:
        DGHEAD   To add 10 to any DOPOL > 0 if the input file is
                 linear.
        POLSET   To do MOD (DOPOL,10) when testing DOPOL.
        VLBPOL   To do MOD (DOPOL,10) when testing DOPOL.
        DATPOL   To use MOD (DOPOL,10) and to omit the parallactic
                 angle change if DOPOL > 10 (set by DGHEAD) or if the
                 output polarization is linear.
        Moved to 31DEC17 (patch) this date.

15116.  January 12, 2018          DO3COLOR              Eric
        Changed the spelling of DO3COL to DO3COLOR in POPSDAT.HLP.
        Changed help files for:
        ANBPL    Add to help file description of DO3COLOR.
        BPLOT    Add a bit to help file description of DO3COLOR.
        ELFIT    Add a little to DO3COLOR help file description.
        GCPLT    Add detail about color usage.
        PCPLT    Add a bit to help file description of DO3COLOR.
        SNIFS    Add a little to the DO3COLOR description
        SNPLT    Add a lot to help file description of DO3COLOR.
        TARPL    Add a bit to help file description of DO3COLOR.
        UVPLT    Add description of DO3COLOR to Explain section
        VPLOT    Change description of DO3COLOR to be more detailed.
                 Upgrade STOKES amd POLPLOT for linears and added
                 options.
        FRPLT    Improve the POLPLOT description to include linears.
        POSSM    Improve the POLPLOT description to include linears.
        Changed Fortran:
        POLCHK   Allow linear polarization strings (affects FRPLT,
                 POSSM, VPLOT)
        ANBPL    Turn off 3-color when only 1 thing plotted, go to
                 color 0.97
        BPLOT    Colors 0 to 0.97 (1 too dark)
        ELFIT    change max color from 0.95 to 0.97.
        FRPLT    Corrected the Stokes labeling on POLPLOT
        PCPLT    Colors 0 to 0.97 (1 too dark)
        POSSM    Corrected the Stokes labeling on POLPLOT
        SNIFS    Prevented an unlikely failure in the coloring logic,
                 colors 0 - 0.97.
        SNPLT    Colors go to 0.97 (pure blue is too dark).  Drop
                 usage of plot types for plots with just 2
                 polarizations and 1 IF.  GRCHAN > 0 made that not
                 show color.
        UVPLT    Colors go to 0.97 (pure blue is too dark)
        VPLOT    Allow more STOKES values including plotting parallel
                 and more than 2.  Fix POLPLOT label and stop color
                 plotting when there is only one thing plotted.
                 reversed the order of colors plotted; now red to
                 blue.
        Moved nowhere.

15117.  January 12, 2018              PBEAM                 Eric
        Changed APARM to VPARM and added VPARM(11) to indicate that
        the data are power rather than voltage.  This case arises when
        the data are from two moving antennas (and hence real
        visibilities).
        Moved nowhere.

15118.  January 16, 2018          Batch                 Eric
        Both QMNGR and AIPSB had the wrong call sequence to subroutine
        BATQ - they lacked the host parameter.  I know I tested this
        to allow remote machine batch jobs.  Somehow, the changed
        programs did not get putbck.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15119.  January 16, 2018           CALIB                Eric
        The self-protective code in CALIB did not allow a multi-source
        file to use SMODEL even when properly specified (some SMODEL
        not zero, no (2nd) model image, only one cal source).  Added
        code to recognize the proper specification and allow it.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15120.  January 17, 2018      Compiling on Macs           Eric
        Changed $SYSMACIN versions of FDEFAULT.SH, LDOPTS.SH to add
        *gfortran* as a possible compiler and changed CCOPTS.SH to
        allow gcc to have characteers both before and after (as with
        gfortran above).
        Moved nowhere.

15121.  January 17, 2018            SOUSP                Eric
        Before plotting, put the fit rms in as the noise for those IFs
        for which the input adverb NOISE was zero.
        Moved nowhere.

15122.  January 19, 2018          SETJY              Eric
        Overhauled the EXPLAIN section of the help file.  It had not
        been updated when the coefficients chosen by APARM(2) were
        changed.  I hope that is more correct and understandable now -
        the coefficients are given in great detail for the more recent
        flux calibrations.  Fixed precursor comments in the Fortran
        as well.
        Moved nowhere.

15123.  January 19, 2018            UVSUB              Eric
        The gridded version of OPCODE 'MODL' only included the last
        field.  This was due to a scaling factor which applies to the
        input visibilities in field 1 but then applies to the sum of
        the model for fields > 1.  Fixed ALGMEM and ALGSTB to set
        this factor to 1 for fields > 1.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15124.  January 20, 2018           UVSUB               Eric
        The fix I did yesterday does not work fully.  Changed ALGSTB
        and ALGMEM to zero the input data when MODL is requested
        before those data are written to the pseudo-AP.  The Q routine
        then adds the scaled model to the data always.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15125.  January 22, 2018           RLDIF               Eric
        The error bars in the SPECTRAL solution were too large.  One
        wants to give something like the expected error - i.e. divide
        by the sqrt of the number of independent samples.  As a proxy
        for this unknown, I changed it to divide by the sqrt of the
        average number of baselines contributing at each time to the
        computation.  The results are reasonable anyway.
        Moved nowhere.

15126.  January 22, 2018          XYDIF                Eric
        For linear polarization the X-Y phase difference is found from
        source(s) that have U flux but zero V flux.  Applying all
        calibration plus DOPOL but not applying parallactic angle in
        the conversion to Stokes, one gets apparent U and V.  The
        ATAN(-Y/U) is then the phase difference.  XYDIF is much like
        RLDIF except for how it determines the phase difference.
        Moved nowhere.

15127.  February 7, 2018          MORIF                 Eric
        Changed error handling when trying to update the NO_BAND
        keyword in CT tables.  The CTINI call can have an error that
        was not tested.  Changed handling of the output frequency
        reference pixel.  It was set to 1 for simplicity, but the
        center of the band is preferable.
        Moved nowhere.

15128.  February 9, 2018         VLATECR               Amy
        Changed VLATECR adding APARM which allows dispersive delay
        correction to be added.  No change neccesary in VLAPROCS, new
        inputs will just be used.
        Moved nowhere.

15129.  February 12, 2018           ICHANSEL             Eric
        Added some examples to help files for ICHANSEL and to the
        ICHANSEL part in help files for BPASS, PCAL, REWAY, RFLAG.
        Moved nowhere.

15130.  February 14, 2018           EDITA                Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL to display the solution weights in SN and CL
        tables along with amplitude, phase, delay, and rate.  Changed
        the display of flagged data in 3 colors to white - the red
        graphics channel was too much like a real color assigned to
        some IF or polarization.  Flagging in 3 colors required some
        change in logic as to the order of erasure and drawing.  The
        weights were already in the data, but were not able to be
        displayed previously.  This caused changes in the help files
        for EDITA, HLPEDICL, and HLPEDISN.
        Moved nowhere.

15131.  February 16, 2018            SNPLT              Eric
        Added OPTYPEs 'RPHS' and 'RDLY' and REFANT to plot the phase
        and delay re-referenced to REFANT.
        Moved nowhere.

15132.  February 16, 2018           QEDIUTIL            Eric
        Changed EDITA and other edit-class tasks to (1) correct some
        too small Formats and (2) to compute the mean and rms of the
        values in the edit display and then to test them in FLAG ABOVE
        and FLAG BELOW.  If the former starts less than avg+rms or the
        latter starts more than avg-rms, then the user is asked if he
        wants to continue.
        Moved nowhere.

15133.  February 20, 2018            XYDIF              Eric
        Added DOINVERS to allow debugging by adding 180 to the
        solutions.
        Moved nowhere.

15134.  February 21, 2018           UVPLT                Eric
        A counter which is tested to see if the data may be
        self-scaled was a mere INTEGER which therefore could roll over
        to negative a 2^31-1.  Changed it to double precision.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15135.  February 22, 2018             CookBook                   Eric
        Changes:
        4       Rewrote the chapter to describe the modern EVLA
                calibration habits based on old appendix E, upgraded
                polarization in particular
        9       Extracted all references to MK III and IV.
        O       New appendix for older systems - contains much of the
                calibration of the old VLA plus sections for Mk III
                and IV.
        E       Deleted the EVLA appendix - some was obsolete, the
                rest moved to 4
        1       Corrected obsolete wording, changed appendix and
                chapter descriptoins
        5       Updated references
        8       Updated references
        A       Updated references
        B       Updated references
        L       Updated reference, added item on polarization
                primarily referencing the section in Chapter 4
        0       Update table of contents, figures, recipes
        I       Update index
        J       Update index
        Moved nowhere.

15136.  February 23, 2018        FREESPAC              Eric
        Changed ZFREE to omit the display of the TIMEDEST limits.
        They are not relevant since TIMEDEST was eliminated.  This
        leaves 5 extra characters for the data directory names, which
        are frequently needed.
        Moved nowhere.

15137.  February 23, 2018        IMFIT, JMFIT          Eric
        Added adverb NDIG to these two tasks.  It will allow you to
        print the map with fewer digits than the default (which is the
        most between 3 and 6 that will fits on the page/screen).
        Moved nowhere.

15138.  February 28, 2018           SETJY              Eric
        It was quoting errors bars for no valid reason for P band at
        least with the PB 2017 fluxes.  Moved the setting of error to
        0 to before the 2017 computation.
        Moved to 31DEC17 1 March.

15139.  March 1, 2018             EDITA                 Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL to correct the multi-band delay option.  Both
        menus had a line they should not have had and the 3-color
        option had not been turned off.
        Moved nowhere.

15140.  March 1, 2018          help file clarity          Eric
        Changed help files to improve clarity:
        RMFIT   Add missing close parentheses, enhanced wording on
                DOSPIX to make it clear that it can be non-zero for
                some components and zero for others.
        SNFLG   Rearranged wording to make separate OPCODEs more
                visible.
        CLCOR   enhance opening paragraphs, emphasize CL version
                handling.
        FRING   Clarify APARM(5)=2 (MB delay) a bit
        EDITA   Clarify DODELAY=2 (MB delay) quite a bit.
        Moved nowhere.

15141.  March 2, 2018               FRING               Eric
        Changed to avoid the flag table sort on the first UVGET
        call when creating an output file.  This may let any failures
        happen faster.
        Moved nowhere.

15142.  March 2, 2018           linear polarization      Eric
        The warning about linear polarization not being calibrated
        should only come when producing Stokes Q, U, and/or V and not
        applying DOPOL.  Changed DGHEAD to be much more selective on
        when to issue this warning.
        MOved nowhere.

15143.  March 5, 2018           TABINI                 Eric
        Added an error message telling file type, disk, cno, version
        for the error condition.  This will let people track down

15144.  March 6, 2018           EDITA                  Eric
        Changed:
        (1) The minimum range down another factor of 10 - 1/10000 of
            the basic unit.
        (2) Changed the average and rms computation to use the median
            and the scaled MAD (median absolute deviation)
        (3) Fixed display of questionable flag below and flag above to
            use the correct units.
        Moved nowhere.

15145.  March 8, 2018     gridded models               Eric
        Changed CCSMEM to check the AP memory and ask for enough -
        somehow it survived when the images were moderately small.
        But it needs in a larger case a lot for the grid plus what was
        already allocated for the UV data.
        Moved to 31DEC17 on 2 April.

15146.  March 8, 2018           ANINI                  Eric
        When over-writing an antenna table, as in VLANT, the number of
        keywords allowed would be <= 51 unless PCAL had been run.  The
        code assumed that PCAL had been run (or was running) and so
        could demand more if the number of IFs was > 26.  Changed to
        check if the file is pre-existing and accept the number of
        keywords in same.
        Moved to 31DEC17 on 2 April.


15147.  March 9, 2018        SN table weights           Eric
        Since SN table weights may now be used to edit UV data in
        EDITA, added comments to the help files of CALIB and FRING to
        describe their special values.  A weight of SNRmin+1 implies a
        suspect solution in CALIB but implies the (good) reference
        antenna in FRING.
        Moved nowhere.

15148.  March 12, 2018            ANINI                 Eric
        The "fix" of March 8 made a requested version of 0 (i.e. make
        a new file) into version 1 and then managed to destroy it.
        This almost certainly would happen only in inadequate AN
        tables that looked as if they needed reformatting.
        Moved nowhere.

15149.  March 12, 2018               DTSIM              Eric
        Fix the AN file creation so that the files do not look
        inadequate.
        Moved nowhere.

15150.  March 14, 2018             DTSIM               Eric
        Changed to omit fully flagged data records and report the
        count.  Corrected the noise routine which did not SAVE an
        important variable.  Corrected the SU table to make epoch 2000
        when not set.
        Moved nowhere.

15151.  March 14, 2018          gridded models          Eric
        the correction made in january to ALGMEM and ALGSTB to compute
        models correctly for multiple facets caused the data weights
        to be zero.  Corrected this by putting an intelligent zeroing
        of the input data (leaving the weights alone).  Discovered
        that the zeroing of the input array when data fall off the
        grid was done with bad lengths and addresses.  Corrected these
        too.  UVSUB made an error in the HI file.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15152.  March 23, 2018              POSSM                 Eric
        The CP plot routine did not test for magic blank in I when
        plotting Q and U and did not test for 0 in I when dividing by
        I.  Both cases arise and, in the former, Q and U were nuts.
        Moved nowhere.

15153.  March 28, 2018              IMAGR                Eric
        Changed QCLEAN to
        (1) Not re-image all facets on REMAKE IMAGES if they are all
            already current.
        (2) Offer an IMSTAT option to do robust and normal statistics
            on the image currently displayed.  All pixels are used,
            not just the current display window.
        Also changed IMAGR and HLPCLEAN help files.
        Moved nowhere.

15154.  March 28, 2018                REWAY              Eric
        Added more tests to make sure that data have been found before
        continuing with the various operations.
        Moved nowhere.

15155.  March 29, 2018            EDITA                 Eric
        Wrote new general purpose routine ANTOUT to find antenna
        numbers called OUT or with 0,0,0 coordinates in the antenna
        file.  Added code in EDITA to use this to set the ANTENNAS
        adverb when the user has not done so.  BDF2AIPS makes a CL
        table with all 28 antennas no matter which ones are valid.
        Moved nowhere.

15156.  March 29, 2018              SNFLG              Eric
        Added flagging on delay/rate rather than amp/phase as an
        option and also an option to flag failed solutions.
        Moved nowhere.

15157.  March 29, 2018             FGSPW              Eric
        Added option SOLINT to control the averaging interval and an
        option to declare the cutoff levels to be in Jy/flux (and so
        are multiplied by the SU table flux as function of source and
        IF before the data comparison).
        Moved nowhere.

15158.  March 29, 2018           FRING                 Eric
        FRING set the multi-band delay to magic blank when doing the
        dispersion option (APARM(10)>0).  It failed to give it a more
        meaningful value even when one was found.  Improved the
        wording a bit in the FRING help file too.
        Moved nowhere.
        Moved nowhere: needs patch?

15159.  April 2, 2018              FITLD                 Eric
        The program tested for duplicate FQIDs but used bad logic to
        substitute a new FQID number for the old.  Corrected the logic
        and improved the messaging.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15160.  April 3, 2018            FITLD                  Eric
        Yesterday's change fixed the UV data, but did not address the
        tables.  Easy changes in the writing of PC, TY, IM and GC
        tables were implemented.  The AT table needed to have FQIDs
        dropped if they were no longer used.  The MC table required
        the FQIDs to be replaced with the corrected ones.  Two new
        subroutines more or less cribbed from DFQID were added to
        FITLD to perform these chores.
        Moved to 31DEC17 4 April..

15161.  April 4, 2018              Misc                 Eric
        DBCON    mention DBAPP in help file
        FRING    count frequency increment errors in CHKFRQ and
                 tone down warning messages.  FRNSEL will find the
                 really egregious issues.
        Moved nowhere.

15162.  April 9. 2018            DBAPP                   Eric
        First serious test in a while.  Fixed
        1. Warn that UT1UTC differs in the antenna headers but do not
           quit.
        2. When testing the times, include any difference in day
           number.
        3. The DUVH common changed some time ago and the parallel
           versions in DBAPP did not keep pace.  The data got trashed
           as a result.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15163.  April 11, 2018               DBAPP               Eric
        One more issue: the NX table needed the addition of any day
        offset to the times of the input NX table and the start vis
        number for the NX table had to point at the last of the input
        version of the output table rather than 0.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this data.

15164.  April 11, 2018              CONVL                Eric
        On OPCODE 'GAUS' the task will now find the largest clean beam
        in the CG table (or the header) to use as a default for BMAJ,
        BMIN, BPA.  Leaving them at zero is still an error for some of
        the OPCODEs.
        Moved nowhere.

15165.  April 13, 2018              dispersion           Eric
        The CL and SN tables have 2 columns for dispersion for the two
        polarizations and both FRING and KRING solve for dispersion
        separately in the two polarizations.  However, the calibration
        routines applied only the first one to all polarizations.
        Changed
        DSEL.INC      Made the dispersion parameters an extra
                      dimension of 2.
        GAININ        Find the second polarization dispersion rather
                      than the unused rate of change of dispersion
        CSLGET        Pick up and use 2 polarizations worth of
                      dispersion
        CGASET        Interpolate 2 polarizations of DDTAB into DDELAY
        DATCAL        Do 4 different dispersion corrections for the 4
                      polarizations.

15166.  April 13, 2018         SNEDT, EDITA              Eric
        Changed QEDIUTIL and the two tasks to allow editing solely on
        dispersion, much like multi-band delay editing.
        Moved nowhere.

15167.  April 16, 2018             FQUBE                 Eric
        FQUBE was writing N CG tables for N input images when there
        was no input CG table.  It should only write one version,
        filling it with N lines.
        Moved TO 31DEC17 23 April.

15168.  April 23, 2018                RLDLY               Eric
        Changed SOLINT to be a true solution interval and added DETIME
        to convey the integration time.  Changed the routine that
        found the list of time ranges to honor TIMERANG even within a
        scan and to break a scan up into equal intervals of length
        approximately SOLINT.
        Moved nowhere.

15169.  April 24, 2018             FITLD               Eric
        The change made in March 2017 to have ANTNAME honored when
        concatenating did not work in complicated circumstances.  I
        have returned FITLD to initializing ANTNAME to blank when
        concatenating.  It sets antenna names/numbers from the
        existing AN table and can add new ones if encountered.
        Moved changes only to 31DEC17 this date.

15170.  April 27, 2018            DOBAND 3              Eric
        The interpolation of bandpasses attempted to use the one good
        one when the other was bad at the upper levels of the code.
        But down at the bottom BPGET blanked the bandpass to be
        applied whenever either of the 2 was blanked.  Changed it to
        use the good one if there is a good one.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15171.  April 27, 2018            QEDIUTIL             Eric
        Changed the order of the SWITCH ALL IF command so that it goes
        from 1 IF to all IFs and then to asking for a range.
        Moved nowhere.

15172.  May 4 & 6, 2018               SPIXR                Eric
        Found a serious bug: incorrect frequencies were used when
        BLC(1) > 1.  The frequency list needs to be shifted down to
        correct for BLC(1).  Another bug caused the frequency written
        to the output header not to be the reference frequency at
        least when the spectral axis was FREQ.ID.
        Added option in CPARM to flag solutions based on excessive
        uncertainties in brightness, spectral index, and curvature.
        Moved nowhere.

15173.  May 4, 2018                ISPEC                Eric
        Added options to plot flux or average on a log-log plot.
        This is good for looking at spectral index.
        Moved nowhere.

15174.  May 7, 2018               SPFIX                 Eric
        NEW TASK: takes the output of SPIXR and makes a model cube
        based on the SPIXR input cube but with the values of the model
        instead of the data.  Optionally writes out the data-model
        cube instead.
        Moved nowhere.

15175.  May 8, 2018        model subtraction              Eric
        When VISDFT attempted to run with data having all 4
        polarizations, it put the pointer telling whether to compute
        the model or to subtract the model on top of the factor for
        the first cross-hand polarization.  This often led to the
        model being computed rather than the data-model.
        Changed the addressing in VISDFT, QXXPTS, QGASUB, and QSPSUB
        to do this right.
        Must go to patch but let's test a bit.

15176.  May 9, 2018         model computation             Eric
        The zeroing of the input data neglected the possibility of
        compressed uv data.  Corrected ALGMEM and ALGSTB to handle
        compressed data as well.
        Should go to patch.

15177.  May 10, 2018            FITLD                    Eric
        Added code to honor ANTNAME anyway when concatenating for
        VLITE, VLB, and even simple lists not including these magic
        words.
        Moved nowhere.

15178.  May 11, 2018              DBCON                 Eric
        The FO (frequency offset) table was omitted from the list of
        tables that need to be concatenated.
        Moved nowhere.

15179.  May 14, 2018              help files             Eric
        Changed help files:
        CLCOR     Added remark about the source shift in ANTP for
                  proper motion.  Time zero is literally 0, the IAT
                  at the start of the first day.
        FARS      Try to reduce the Russian language barrier.
        DOFARS    Same as FARS
        Moved nowhere.

15180.  May 14, 2018              UVRANGE                Eric
        UVRANGE was applied only to the uv values at the header
        frequency.  With wide bandwidths, values of baseline twice as
        high as UVRANGE(2) could easily appear.  Changed everything to
        apply UVRANGE at the frequency of each spectral window (IF).
        This lets some samples slightly greater than UVRANGE(2)
        through but does not require the intense coputation that
        applying this selection on a channel-by-channel basis would
        require.  Changed:
        DSEL.INC   Added logical DOUVRA to control if UVRANGE is
                   really being applied
        DCHND.INC  Added CHNIF so that the maximum IF would be
                   carried.
        SELINI     Set DOUVRA default
        UVGET      Set actual value of DOUVRA and if true call CHNDAT
                   to initialize the DCHND common.
        DATGET     Remove the old UVRANGE test and add calls to
                   DATUVR.
        DATUVR     New subroutine to compute U and V as a function of
                   IF and flag those IFs falling outside UVRANGE.
        Moved nowhere.

15181.  May 14, 2018              COMB                   Eric
        The adjustment for mismatched beam areas should not be done on
        MULT.  Furthermore it should appear in the message file not
        just the history file.
        Moved nowhere.

15182.  May 22, 2018             BADDISK                Eric
        Added BADDISK to all tasks that could sort FG or PC tables:
        ACCOR  ACSCL  ALVPR  AVSPC  BLAVG  BPWAY  BPWGT  BSCAN  CORER

15183.  May 24, 2018               FRING                 Eric
        When writing out a calibrated single-source file, the default
        should not be to average all spectral channels.  Made DPARM(6)
        >= 0 be to preserve the channels.
        Moved nowhere.

15184.  May 24, 2018                RFLAG                Eric
        (1) RFLAG was applying UVRANGE itself rather than letting
            UVGET take care of it.  Therefore, it did not benefit from
            the change made recently.  Switched it to doing UVRANGE in
            UVGET so that it will be applied on a spectral-window
            basis.
        (2) Added test for more flags than can be written to the FG
            table = 2147480000 which is a bit before the overflow.
            The task will issue a message and close gently.
        (3) Added comment to help file that the times in the file must
            be reasonably well distributed.  Data sets produced by
            UBAVG or STUFFR (which uses UBAVG) should not be used.
        Moved nowhere.

15185.  June 1, 2018            EDITA et al             Eric
        Changed the color scheme to amke the increments between colors
        be larger in QEDIUTIL.
        Moved nowhere.

15186.  June 4, 2018             PLOTC                  Eric
        NEW TASK: Plots colors as they are used by tasks with labeling
        to try to make it clear whcih color goes with which.
        Supported tasks are ANBPL, EDITA, EDITR, ELFIT, SNEDT, SNIFS,
        SNPLT, UVPLT, and VPLOT.  The help file for SNIFS was expanded
        a bit.
        Moved nowhere.

15187.  June 5, 2018            PLOTC               Eric
        Fortran: dropped adverbs QUAL and CALCODE which were not
        properly supported where it mattered.  Chnaged to set the
        internal source variable only for SNPLT, SNIFS, and ELFIT.
        Fixed the call sequence to SOURNU - QUAL is an array that must
        be set to -1 if we want to ignore it and the source names must
        be in character form.  Also added tests to avoid zero divides
        when failing to find the desired table data.
        Help: Rewrote the introduction completely, added clarification
        about when certain adverbs are used.
        Moved nowhere.

15188.  June 6, 2018            OMFIT                 Eric
        The task limited the number of antennas to 80 for no good
        reason.  But when we raised that to 300, dynamic memory issues
        arose.  Changed the code to use dynamic memory only in cases
        needing more than 1024 or 2048 words.  Also made the dynamic
        memory areas bigger and started a little way into the memory.
        This seems to fix things mysteriously.  Als added code to
        switch to micro Jy in the flux display when appropriate.
        Moved nowhere.

15189.  June 11, 2018                UVHOL              Eric
        Added OPTYPE='PLOT' to make plots of the holography data in
        AIPS plot files or the TV.  Lots new adverbs and moved from
        $APGNOT to $YPGNOT.
        Moved nowhere.

15190.  June 13, 2018             UVHOL               Eric
        Changed sign of APARM(7) so that amp/phase is the default.
        Added DPARM(7) > 0 -> plot phase or imaginary.  Fixed axis
        labeling to distinguish amp, real, imaginary.  Added separate
        plot routine for phase and fixed it to handle either -180 to
        180 range or 0 to 360 whichever is smaller or PIXRANGE if
        specified.
        Moved nowhere.

15191.  June 18, 2018              TLCAL               Eric
        NEW TASK: It reads a Telcal file and makes an SN table with
        the gains, phases, and delays determined by the VLA on-line
        system.  These are scan average values like the usual initial
        use of CALIB but have a time variable delay unlike the usual
        FRING recommendation (one delay for whole run).  The task
        depends on recognizing the IF through a combination of the
        codes in the telcal file and the frequency.  It also must
        recognize the source name.  Using the IF codes should allow
        for observations in which 2 or more IFs have the same
        frequency.
        Moved nowhere.

15192.  June 21, 2018               COMB                Eric
        The loops that search for the FREQ axis for SPIX and RM only
        went to the number of axes in the first input image.  Changed
        to also look up to the number of axes in the second image.
        Moved nowhere.

15193.  June 26, 2018             DOBAND 3              Eric
        The gfortran LNX64 compilation of BPGET in optimized mode
        produced wrong answers.  Changed OPTIMIZE.LIS to compile this
        routine no-opt and also changed another oddity having to do
        with interpolation in the presence of blanked solutions.
        Both issues caused loss of data.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15194.  June 26, 2018           EXTLIST, PLGET           Eric
        Corrected AU2A (PLGET) and AU8A (EXTLIST) for the addition of
        BADDISK to ALVAR, ANBPL, CAPLT, CLPLT, DFTPL, RFLAG, UVHGM,
        VPLOT, and WETHR.  DFTPL was wrong due to the insertion of
        STOKES.  EVAUV was re-done because so many adverbs have been
        added (calibration etc.).  PLOTC, UVHOL, and PBEAM were added.
        Changed these tasks to make sure that adverb values (and fit
        answers in PBEAM) are in the plot file precursor section for
        EXTLIST to use.  Changed precursor comments to GINIT.
        Moved nowhere.

15195.  June 28, 2018         BPEDT, PCEDT                Eric
        Add CROWDED and DO3COLOR to both to do crowded times.
        Most of the changes were in BPEDIT.
        Moved nowhere.

15196.  June 29, 2018           LET18A                   Eric
        Finished the June 2018 AIPSLetter.  There was no room for the
        shipping statistics in this 6-page one.  Does not include
        changes 15194 and 15195.
        Moved everywhere in $AIPSPUBL and web.

15197.  June 29, 2018           BPEDT                  Eric
        Changed
        BPEDIT    To display and edit with BP weights also.  Required a
                  bunch more options in the menu and arrays to go from
                  zero rather than the default 1.  Contains code for
                  DPEDT which is not yet complete.
        HLPEDIBP  To cover the changes due to CROWDED and to the weight
                  display (SHOW ALSO, SHOW, SET RANGE).
        HLPEDIPC  To cover the changes due to crowded.
        BPEDT    Help explain section to add the new menu options
        Moved nowhere.

15198.  July 2, 2018             PDEDT                 Eric
        NEW TASK: interactive editor using PD (polarization D-term)
        tables.  It will write out a flagged PD table and can also
        write entries in a flag table, but the user must specify the
        source name(s) and time range.  Includes PDEDT help file and
        HLPEDIPD run-time help file.  HLPEDIBP and HLPEDIPC were also
        updated to remove reference to the non-existant expert mode
        and ALL vs ONE IF option.
        Moved nowhere.

15199.  July 5, 2018             FRING                 Eric
        Added another APARM(5) option indicated by a value < 0.
        In that case, a new adverb BPARM is used to give the end IF
        numbers of the groups of IFs which are solved.  Thus
        BPARM = 3, 7, 16 would solve for 3 delays, one in IFs 1-3, one
        in IFs 4-7, and one in IFs 8-16.  This option is helpful given
        the variety of options now offered by the Widar correlator.
        Also discovered that certain math conditions could cause the
        task to produce rates even when DPARM(9) > 0.  Added flagging
        of rates in the main routine (FRNDRP) that computes them and
        corrected existing code for such flagging.  The old code ended
        up with diagonal matrix terms set to 0 which leads to failed
        solutions.  Fortunately, the old code had no real way to turn
        on the rate or delay flagging.
        Moved nowhere.

15200.  July 6, 2018             BPEDT                 Eric
        It allowed BD, CP, and PD values of INEXT but BPEDIT does not
        support those types.  Fixed code to match help file.
        Moved nowhere.

15201.  July 6, 2018              PLOTC                Eric
        Added BPEDT and PCEDT to PLOTC, including TIMERANG as a new
        adverb.  Changed AU2A and AU8A (PLGET, EXTLIST) for this.
        Moved nowhere.

15202.  July 10, 2018           TABSRT                   Eric
        Apparently TABSRT can ask for really large buffers.
        Changed ZMIO to allow 256 Mword IO requests and fixed one of
        the ZMEMRY 'FREE' (error recovery) calls to the name used in
        the GET.
        Moved nowhere.

15203.  July 10, 2018             SETJY                 Eric
        Made up synonyms for the 11 special sources in the latest flux
        form (e.g. 3C380, Cygnus A, Virgo A etc).  Fixed code to avoid
        printing previous fluxes when there were none.  Updated the
        explain file to show all the synonyms for the special and more
        normal sources.
        Moved nowhere.

15204.  July 10, 2018             PIPEAIPS                Lorant
        Added the new parameter of FRING (aparm(5)=-1 to use BPARM) to
        the pipeline as parameter BBMAXIF. Also added FACTOR to allow
        for frequency averaging of the data to reduce data set size.
        Moved nowhere.

15205.  July 11, 2018                EDITR               Eric
        QEDIUTIL did not fill in all the record pointers when reading
        UV data.  It left off the last one which caused UNDO FLAG
        operations that extended to the last time to fail to undo the
        flags.  The routine that returns the real times from the
        record numbers had an oddity corrected.
        Moved nowhere.

15206.  July 16, 2018          DOPOL                  Eric
        Changed POLSET to look for magic blanks in the solution and
        pass them on in POLCAL properly.  Changed DATPOL to look for
        these blanks and to flag appropriate visibilities if they
        appear.  Also changed the specialized routines LXYPOL, VLBPOL,
        and ORIPOL to handle blanked D-term solutions.  They are more
        complicated.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15207.  July 16, 2018             BPEDT                  Eric
        Raised the number of allowed colors to 5120.  The old limit of
        256 is not enough in bad cases.
        Moved nowhere.

15208.  July 17, 2018              BPASS                Eric
        Improved the wording in the help file about BPASSP(10) at a
        very repetitive and pedantic level.
        Moved nowhere.

15209.  July 17, 2018             BPEDIT                Eric
        Corrected:
        1. A call in EDITPC was to BPGTPD rather than BPGTPC so PC
           data were not read.
        2. The call to BP3CIN was missing from EDITPC so the color
           table for DO3COLOR was left zero.
        3. In 8 places, the surrent time pointer TIMEC needed to be
           set back to its input value after having been used in
           flagging loops.  This meant that after the first FLAG AREA
           the second would not work unless one returned to the main
           menu in between.
        Moved nowhere.

15210.  July 18, 2018    VLBAUTIL, VLBAEOPS, VLBATECR    Amy
        Added EOPSFILE and TECRFILE parameters to VLBAEOPS and
        VLBATECR respectively.  Updated VLBAUTIL to handle these
        new parameters.  If these parameters are set then the
        procedures assume that the files are on disk and do not
        attempt to download them.
        Moved nowhere.

15211.  July 19, 2018             CookBook                   Eric
        Changes:
        4       FGSPW uses SOLINT, UVRANGE on a per IF basis (nice for
                RFLAG), FRING BPARM option
        5       IMAGR option IMSTAT
        6       Add PLOTC
        7       SPFIX on output of SPIXR, DPARM/CPARM in SPIXR
        9       EDITA can be used for dispersive delay, VLBAEOPS,
                VLBATECR
        13      For updated ABOUT lists
        O       TVFLG now allows 4 Stokes
        C       VLBAEOPS, VLBATECR

        I       Update index
        J       Update index

        Moved nowhere.

15212.  July 19, 2018               ABOUT lists          Eric
        Changed: ZZANALYSIS, ZZCALIBRAT, ZZEDITING, ZZIMAGING,
        ZZINTERACT, ZZOOP, ZZPLOT, ZZPOLARIZA, ZZTABLE, ZZTASK,
        ZZTV-APPL, ZZUV, ZZVLA, ZZVLBI
        Moved nowhere.

15213.  July 20, 2018          EDITA, BPEDT, etc         Eric
        Changed
        QEDIUTIL   Routine EDFIND to test for the most desirable
                   values close to the input position.
        BPEDIT     1. BPFIND was returning bad answers.  Changed the
                      limits used and how the most desirable value was
                      found.  Also changed to loop over all times
                      (when appropriate) before ending the search for
                      a nearby sample.
                   2. BPPLT1 - added finding a returning the median
                      plotted point and the rms version of the MAD.
                   3. FLAG ABOVE and FLAG BELOW now check the request
                      flag against the median/rms and inquire on ones
                      that would flag an awful lot.
                   4. Only set IS3COL when all times are displayed and
                      DO3COL was requested.  It used to ignore that
                      latter critical option and so had no colors to
                      show.
                   5. Limited flagging messages - with lots of times
                      we don't need one for each time!
                   6. FLAG CHANNEL and CHAN RANGE now set all times
                      (when appropriate) and so avoid having to flag
                      each time individually.
        Moved nowhere.

15214.  July 23, 2018             RLDLY               Eric
        Added DOIFS=-1 to use BPARM to define the IF ranges to be
        used in doing the delay fitting.  This matches the option
        in FRING.
        Moved nowhere.

15215.  July 23, 2018              RLDIF               Eric
        Put a 4th order polynomial in for 3C286 which ranges from 33
        at 1 GHz to 36 at 43.5 GHz.  Frequencies below 4.5 are
        assigned 33, above 45 are assigned 36, in between uses the
        polynomial.  It was found that 3C48 and 3C147 used the table
        values appropriate to 3C138!  That has been fixed.  It also
        meant to return not a value for the low frequencies of 3C147
        but the higher level routines took -999 to be a real value.
        Fixed that too.
        Moved nowhere.

15216.  July 24, 2018             SNPLT                 Eric
        When the last row of a table was flagged, the routines that
        read the table did not change the error code from -1 to 0
        causing the main routine to quit.  Changed to correct this 2
        places.
        Moved nowhere.

15217.  July 30, 2018            LUNTMP                  Eric
        An test early in the routine did not allow the type value 3
        which is intended for text files.
        Moved nowhere.

15218.  July 31, 2018            QCREATE                 Eric
        Changed POPSDAT to make the default QCREATE to be TRUE and
        fixed AU2A for the new default.  Added a message to ZCREAT to
        comment when filling a file with zeros that is > 1/2 Gbyte.
        That will propogate slowly into all of AIPS.
        Moved nowhere.

15219.  August 7, 2018          SYMBOL XYRATIO          Eric
        Some tasks modify the size parameters for plotting so that the
        circles come out round no matter what XYRATIO.  Fixed EVAUV,
        ALVAR, EELFIT, RFLAG, SNFIT, SNIFS, SNPLT, and UVHOL so their
        symbols also come out the same size in x and y.
        Moved nowhere.

15220.  August 7, 2018             PEEK                 Eric
        NEW TASK: This is really just for VLA maintenance.  It reads a
        pointing correction text file and computes a model fit to the
        measured (additional) corrections.  It writes several output
        text files and, in this version, can also make AIPS plots on
        the TV or in plot files.  This is a version of the stand-alone
        program maintained by Ken Sowinski and attempts to replicate
        its answers and output files.  Changed ZTXOPN and ZTXOP2 to
        enable replacing an existing text file ('REWR' re-write and
        'QREW' quiet re-write).
        Moved nowhere.

15221.  August 7, 2018            OKCOLORS              Eric
        NEW PROCEDURE in POPSDAT.  Sets PLCOLORS for a white
        background and adequate color and contrast for line types 1,
        2, 3, 4, and 9.  New help file and added to help files for
        PLCOLOR and LWPLA.
        Moved nowhere.

15222.  August 10, 2018          OOSUB              Eric
        OOSUB attempted to read multi-source files to do its thing.
        The standard OOP code however caused the output file to lose
        the FREQSEL random parameter, so the file being written was
        larger than the file that was created and had the wrong
        structure.  Changed the type of open done on the input and
        moved the close to after the output file creation.  This fixes
        the problem.  Added note to help file informing the user that
        multi-source files will be allowed, but that bad things will
        happen if more than one source is actually in the file.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15223.  August 10, 2018            SCAT                Eric
        Created new verb SCAT in POPSDAT and NEWPARMS.  Changed AU1A
        to call CATLST for 'SC' files for all disks.  Changed CATLST
        to be happy about this and to print the disk header only when
        some file to be printed is found.  So disks with no files of
        the requested type will not be mentioned in MCAT, UCAT, and
        CATALOG.
        Moved nowhere.

15224.  August 10, 2018            OOSUB                Eric
        Drop ONEFREQ adverb, force it true in the code for the PBUTIL
        routines. Drop ONEFREQ from help, mention that OOSUB assumes it.
        Moved nowhere.

15325.  August 10, 2018             BPEDT               Eric
        Fixed typo affecting ENTER WT RANGE in BPEDIT.
        Moved nowhere.

15226.  August 14, 2018           PEEK                  Eric
        Chnaged GINIT comment for PEEK type 55, AU2A for PLGET on
        PEEK, and AU8A for EXTLIST on PEEK.  Changed PEEK itself to
        insure that all defaults are filled in for EXTLIST.
        Moved nowhere.

15227.  August 15, 2018            IMAGR              Eric
        IMAGR works hard to determine the average frequency of the
        data samples that go into the image.  This average includes
        only the samples that were not flagged and so may not be the
        simple average of the frequencies that would have gone into
        the image in the absence of flagging.  HOWEVER, when the
        spectral index option IMAGRPRM(2) is used, the simple average
        is used to scale the fluxes and so should be the frequency
        cited in the output image header even if it does not match the
        true average exactly.  Changed IMAGR.FOR to use the simple
        average rather than the true when IMAGRP(2) is not zero.
        Moved nowhere.

15228.  August 15-16, 2018     help stuff, CookBook        Eric
        Update HLPIT.LIS (TAB completion control) for all the new
        things.  ABOUT files on CALIBRAT, CATALOG, TASK, VERB, and VLA

15230.  August 17, 2018            AIPS                 Eric
        In AU2, there was an error when the number of adverb values
        exactly fill N disk records for the TD file used to
        communicate with tasks.  In general, the TPUT/VPUT file would
        not also have this condition, but when the fTD condition was
        met the last of the TPUT or TGET file was not written.  RLDLY
        hit this case when I aadded BPARM.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15233.  August 29, 2018           UVGIT                  Eric
        An EXTERNAL statement was left over from UVFIT with the
        references not satisfied.  Apparently at least one old
        compiler cared about this.
        Moved nowhere.

15234.  August 29, 2018           LWPLA                  Eric
        Changed default gamma correction from 1 to 2.5
        Moved nowhere.

15235.  August 29, 2018          RLDLY                  Eric
        Changed the task to have SOLINT < 0 mean to average over the
        full time range.  A second use of the NX table in the fitter -
        after a full list of (sub-)scans had already been prepared had
        to be dropped.  Changed the help file to describe BPARM, which
        was in the INPUTS section but not the HELP section.  Also
        changed the SOLINT description to make the new usage
        reasonably clear.  FRING has some issues with its description
        of APARM(5) in the help file.
        Moved nowhere.

15236.  August 30, 2018           UVIMG, UVPLT           Eric
        Both passed array dimensions to subroutines using an array.
        Some (probably old) compilers do not like this, so changed to
        spell it out in separate variables.
        Moved nowhere.

15237.  August 30, 2018         LOCIT, EXTLIST            Eric
        Changed LOCIT to have the adverb values available on the GINIT
        call with defaults filled in.  Changed GINIT, AU8A, AU2A to
        support plot ID 56 in EXTLIST and PLGET.
        Moved nowhere.

15238.  September 4, 2018              Misc               Eric
        Moved the HYB and COMAP help and run files to the $APLCONTR
        area since they cannot work (they use MX).  This requires
        changes to help files HLPIT.LIS, LSAPROPO, and about files for
        ANALYSIS, AP, CALIBRAT, IMAGING, RUN, TASK, VLA, VLBI.
        Moved nowhere.

15239.  September 6, 2018         CookBook               Eric
        Corrected typos in all chapters of the CookBook except
        Appendix A.  Dropped HYB from Chapter 9 and 13, dropped CO_MAP
        from 13.  Updated line counts in Chapter 1, source names for
        SETJY in Chapter 4, and mentioned Appendix V in 1 and 4.
        Moved nowhere (or everywhere).

15240.  September 12, 2018          CQ table             Eric
        The VLA now offers post-correlation frequency averaging so it
        appears that a CQ table to carry info about the initial
        bandwidth is needed.  OBIT has started writing this for
        BSDF2AIPS.  Changes needed:
        DSEL.INC   Make NXDSM a float rather than integer.  The
                   channel averaging can be something other than
                   integer in e.g. SPECR.
        DSMEAR     Change multiple (NXDSM in DSEL, NSPECA in DSMEAR)
                   from integer to float.  Add recognition of EVLA to
                   ICQVBA (outside world, NETVLB in DSMEAR).  Added
                   code to set the taper string of JIF to that of IF 1
                   if it is blank ahead of the call to FXSEG.  The
                   strings from the CQ table required the use of JTRIM
                   to get rid of null bytes.
        DATCAL     Take error from FXSEG simply to set factor to 1.
                   Do delay amplitude corrections for EVLA as well as
                   VLBA.
        GAININ     Changed a comment
        Moved nowhere.

15241.  September 12, 2018          VPLOT, DOBAND        Eric
        DOBAND was calibrating weights for non-VLA data using the
        average over all channels of the amoplitude correction.  The
        modern VLBA has edge channel issues and so they should not be
        included.  Changed DATBND to scale weights by the average of
        the inner 7/8 of the channels (3/4 for VLA).
        Changed VPLOT test on sum of weights from 1.e-10 to 1.e-20.
        Moved nowhere.

15242.  September 14, 2018          IMFIT, JMFIT           Eric
        Changed the local determination of the RMS from a self-scaled
        histogram to a robust method.  The former could get confused
        and fail.  The latter can also fail if given a small radius,
        so if it does it then uses the full image plane.  The help
        files were corrected re output adverb names and the change in
        the rms computation.
        Moved  nowhere.

15243.  September 14, 2018             RSTOR              Eric
        Added a clarification to the help file.
        Moved nowhere.

15244.  September 20, 2018           LISTR             Eric
        Left open the FQ table when checking lines of printed output,
        caused trouble later on when actually printing.
        Moved nowhere.

15245.  September 20, 2018           BPCOR            Eric
        This little used task had a gross error when normalizing the
        BP amplitudes.  It summed and normalized the real part and
        looked at the imaginary part only to test for blanks!  This
        would change the phases which are not necessaily 0 and not
        normalize the bandpass.
        Moved nowhere.

15246.  September 20, 2018        RSTOR           Eric
        Added RSTOR to the no-optimize list for LNX64 - it is very
        like APCLN and seems maybe to have the same issues.
        Moved nowhere.

15247.  September 24, 2018       DSORC                 Eric
        Blocked messages about changing unspecified sources (0) to
        source 1.
        Moved nowhere.

15248.  September 24, 2018          BSCAN             Eric
        Inaccuracy in times led to confusion.  Add 0.1 sec to scan
        stop times to avoid data apparently off the end (and a nearly
        infinite loop).
        Moved nowhere.

15249.  September 25, 2018          VLBABPSS             Eric
        Corrected help file - this proc does not run ACSCL.  Added
        info about using VLBAAMP after VLBABPSS.
        Moved nowhere.

15250.  September 25, 2018            FITLD              Eric
        Added DOWEIGHT adverb which when > 0 causes the weights to be
        scaled by integration time (sec) times bandwidth (Hz).  This
        places the weights on a more sensible scale when the
        amplitudes are calibrated.
        Moved nowhere.

15251.  September 25, 2018            EOPs               Eric
        CLCOR does not seem to handle concatenated data sets correctly
        for the EOP operation.  Added warnings to the help files for
        CLCOR and VLBAEOPS.
        Moved nowhere.

15252.  September 26, 2018           IM2CC               Eric
        Added some words to the help to try top make the interaction
        of ICUT and FLUX clearer.
        Moved nowhere.

15253.  September 26, 2018            TLCAL              Eric

15254.  September 28, 2018         CookBook C              Eric
        Minor type setting and wording changes to LaCookC.  One
        reference added to LaCookI and LaCookJ.
        Moved nowhere.

15255.  September 28, 2018         TLCAL                  Eric
        Forgot to resume AIPS on RQUICK.

15256.  October 1, 2018            PCCOR                  Eric
        Put in code to detect when there is a many-tone PC table.
        When found messages about PCFLG, PCRMS, PPCFIT, AIPS Memo 123
        are generated as well as noting that  FRING will still be
        needed.  The task dies then.  Added paragraph to help file
        also.
        Moved nowhere.

15257.  October 2, 2018               TGREP             Eric
        NEW TASK which also may be run as a stand-alone program.
        It searches all user's TGET files and reports the usage of the
        specified task.  It matches the letters of PRTASK so that more
        than one task can be reported.  The reports are in
        alphabetical order by task name and, within each task, in time
        order of last usage.
        Moved nowhere.

15258.  October 3, 2018               RM                Eric
        Despite the help file claiming that the task could do 65000
        frequencies, it could only do 5 due to the size of the
        spectral row buffer!  Made that buffer suitably large.
        Moved to 31DEC17 this date.

15259.  October 18, 2018           CPASS               Eric
        Changed to recognize and honor XX/YY polarization also.
        Movd nowhere.

15260.  October 18, 2018           FITLD               Eric
        My DOWEIGHT addition was done without realizaing that the
        correlation weight had to be divided into the visibility.
        So, making the weights 10^6 larger made the visibilities 10^6
        smaller.  Fixed to apply the actual integration time and
        bandwidth to the output weights only after the visibility date
        are scaled.
        Moved nowhere.

15261.  October 19, 2018             BPWAY             Eric
        Added FPARM(10) > 1 to ignore input weights everywhere,
        > 0 to ignore them on output, and <= 0 to use them everywhere.
        Moved nowhere.

15262.  October 24, 2018            BPASS                 Eric
        Add comments to help fil about normalization when using
        multiple calibration sources.
        Moved nowhere.

15263.  November 5, 2018            DBCON              Eric
        When 2 antennas were named OUT the program thought that there
        was an error and issued dire warnings.  Blocked this issue.
