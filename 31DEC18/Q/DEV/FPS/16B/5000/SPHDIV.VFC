"  VERSION FOR FPS5000 (RECT FLAKY)
"
"     SPHDIV divides the model visibility derived from spherical
"     components into visibility records.  Arbitrary numbers
"     of frequencies and polarizations can be processed.
"     The weights of the visibilities are multiplied times
"     the square of the amplitude of the model visibility.
"
"     SPHDIV uses AP locations 0 and 1 and expects an array
"     beginning in location 2 composed of:
"              Freq(0) / Freq(ref) - 1.0
"              Freq(1) / Freq(0)   - 1.0
"                      .
"                      .
"                      .
"              Freq(NF-1) / Freq(NF-2) - 1.0

"     U       Base address of U's, assumed followed by V, W
"     VS      Base address of vis rec. (real, imag, wt)
"     INCVS   Increment of VS for next visibility
"     INCF    Increment of VS for next frequency
