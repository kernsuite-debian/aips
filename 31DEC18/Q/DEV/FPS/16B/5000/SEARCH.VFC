"    VFC ROUTINE
"   SEARCH is a routine to do a gridded fringe search by means of
"   padded FFTs.  The number (size) of the FFTs is NF (MT) +
"   NR (MF).
"   Inputs:
"    NF     I*2    No. frequency channels.
"    NT     I*2    No. time points.
"    MF     I*2    No. points for freq. FFT.
"    MT     I*2    No. points for time FFT.
"    ND     I*2    No. delay channels to search.
"    NR     I*2    No. rate channels to search.
"    DATA P I*4    Base address of data array (NT,NF)
"    Also expects in the AP memory:
"    0  => COS (PHASE0)    PHASE0 = 0.0
"    1  => SIN (PHASE0)
"    2  => COS (del PHASE T)  del PHASE T = -2*Pi*(NR/2)/MT
"    3  => SIN (del PHASE T)
"    4  => COS (del Phase F)  del PHASE F = -2*Pi*(ND/2)/MF
"    5  => SIN (del PHASE F)
"        These phases should make the center come out in cell
"        (ND/2+1, NR/2+1)
"
"    Output:
"    0 => 1 dim. array index for peak.
"    1 => peak amplitude
"    2 => peak phase.
