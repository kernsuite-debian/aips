  ******************************************************************

Spacing/position is significant for columns 1 and 2.  The first item must
be in column 1 and there must be exactly two spaces between it and column
2.

Fields: 1 = "+"  host runs AIPS and can/will run a TV server (e.g. XAS),
            "-"  host is a TV server only (does not run AIPS), and
            "="  host is an X11 display terminal (does not run AIPS).
        2 = hostname, uppercase (NOT qualified, i.e. FOO, not FOO.EDU)
        3 = architecture (SUN4, SOL, HP, ALPHA, LINUX, SGI, DEC, ...)
              Note: byte order and f.p. format MUST be identical on all
              hosts within a given "site"; see item 4.
        4 = Site.  Use same string for all your entries at one site.
              You can specify two sites if you want to have big- and
              little-endian systems share the same directory tree.
        5 = Default server for X terminal (ignored for AIPS hosts, TV
              servers)
        6 = description (for people and your own benefit).  Do NOT use a
              "?" anywhere in the description if you use csh or tcsh as
              your shell; this will break the HOSTS.CSH script.

SAMPLE SETUP FOLLOWS (you can delete any lines starting with "*", and
        use a "+" or "-" in column 1 instead).
