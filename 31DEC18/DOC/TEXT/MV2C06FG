Flag table         FGdssvv
 
 
 
A. Overview
 
   This extension table for a uv data set contains the
editing  information.  This information may or may not have been
applied to the data depending on the uv data file type. This file will
contain a list of specifications of data to be flagged.
 
Names: The file name is FGdsssvv where d the AIPS update code,
sss=catalog number and vv = version number.
 
B.  File structure.

     Each logical record consists of a specification of data to be
flagged.  These specifications are independent and may overlap.  Data
is to be rejected if it is specified in any flagging record that is
currently selected.  Any entry may be temporarily disabled by deselecting
that table entry.
 
 
    The file header record contains no KEYWORDs.


   Table entries:

       Title      Units   code       Description
  ------------- --------- ----  -------------------------------------------
    SOURCE                1I    Source id number of the source to be
                                flagged.
                                0 => all sources
    SUBARRAY              1I    Subarray number, 0 => all
    FREQ ID               1I    Freq. ID number, -1 => all
    ANTS                  2I    1st element = number of the first
                                antenna,  0 => all baselines to all
                                antennas flagged. 2nd element =
                                number of the second antenna,
                                0 => all baselines to ANT1 flagged
    TIMERANG      Days    2E    Beginning and end time of flagging in
                                the same system as the data is labeled.
                                Both = 0 => data flagged for all times.
    IFS                   2I    Numbers of first and last IF group
                                to be flagged.
    CHANS                 2I    First and last channel number in IF group.
    PFLAGS                4X    Array of flags for the polarizations.
                                4 are kept even if fewer polarizations
                                are present. Flags in same order as data,
                                bit set => correlator value flagged.
    REASON               24A    Reason code for flagging (24 char)
 
C. User notes.
 
  The "code" column is element_count + basic type code.
basic type codes: D=Double precision, E=single precision,
   A=character, J=long integer, L=logical, I=short integer, X=bit.
