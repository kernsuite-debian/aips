IN4NAME   LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

IN4NAME
Type: Adverb  (String*12)
Use:  Data files are stored in AIPS under logical names which
      have 4 parts: a 12-character "name" field, a 6-character
      "class" field, and a numeric "sequence number" field.
      IN4NAME is used to specify the "name" field for the 4th
      of the input data files used by a verb or task.  This
      adverb is handled by AIPS tasks and verbs under special
      "wildcard" rules.  These rules determine which test
      strings (e.g. image names in the catalog) match the
      user-specified string.  Except for '*', '?', and trailing
      blanks (when an * is present), all characters specified
      in IN4NAME must exactly match the corresponding characters
      in the test string.  A '?' in IN4NAME matches any single
      character in the test string.  An '*' in IN4NAME matches
      0 or more characters in the test string.  Thus, IN4NAME
      = '*' matches any test string.  IN4NAME = 'A?B*D' matches
      'ASBD', 'A BXYZD D', and 'A4B45678901D', but does not
      match 'ABCD' or 'ASBCDE'.
Null value:  '          '
      Taken as '*' unless the Help file for the specific task
      or verb states otherwise.
