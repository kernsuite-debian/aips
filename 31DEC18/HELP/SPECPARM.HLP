SPECPARM
Type: Adverb (Real array(4,20))
Use:  Spectral index S as a function of polarization (I, Q, U, V) and
      source number where

            log(T(f)/T(f0) = S * log(f/f0)

Tasks:
  PCAL......Computes antenna-based polarization leakage terms and,
            optionally, also determines source polarization (Q, U, V).
            SPECPARM sets spectral indices to be used in applying
            source models including the total intensity which is used
            while fitting for source Q and U.
