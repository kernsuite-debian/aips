TKGUESS
Type: Verb
Use:  Plot the curve described by the initial guess of the
      gaussian components.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name (name).         Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name (class).        Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name (seq. #).       0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk unit #.               0 => any.
  INVERS......Version # of SL file.      0 => highest version #
  LTYPE.......Labelling type, see HELP LTYPE for details:
              1 = border, 2 = no ticks, 3 or 7 = standard, 4 or 8 =
              relative to ref. pixel, 5 or 9 = relative to subimage
              (BLC, TRC) center, 6 or 10 = pixels.  7-10 all labels
              other than tick numbers and axis type are omitted.
              Add n * 100 to alter the metric scaling.
  PIXRANGE....Min,Max of Image intensity.  0 => entire range
  BDROP.......No of slice pts to omit from beginning of slice.
  EDROP.......No of slice points to omit from end of slice.
  NGAUSS......No of gaussian components.
  GPOS........Initial guess of positions of the components.
  GMAX........Initial guess of maximum amplitudes.
  GWIDTH......Initial guess of widths at 1/2 max amplitudes.
