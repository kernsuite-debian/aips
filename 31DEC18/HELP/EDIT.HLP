----------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT
Type:  Pseudoverb    (ONLY statement on the input line)
Use:   To cause POPS to enter the edit an existing procedure
       mode and to specify the procedure name and line number.
Grammar:   EDIT  name  line
       where name is the procedure name and line is the first
       line number to be edited.  If line specifies an
       existing line of code, then the line is deleted.  If
       line specifies a non-existant line number (e.g. 2.5),
       then no lines are deleted.  Lines typed in this mode
       are inserted into the procedure until an ENDEDIT
       command is given.
Example: > EDIT   DUMMY  3
         : code1
         : code2
         : code3
         : ENDEDIT
         >
       will replace line 3 of DUMMY with code1, insert new lines
       of text code2 and code3 as new line numbers 4 and 5, and
       renumber old lines 4 through ? to 6 through ?+2.  The
       prompt symbols sent by AIPS are shown in the example.
       HINT: use the LIST name pseudoverb before each edit
       session.  NOTE that this pseudoverb must be the only
       command on the input line.
