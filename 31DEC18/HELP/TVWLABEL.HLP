TVWLABEL
Type: Verb
Use:  TVWLABEL will label a wedge on the TV.  If there is more than
      one image (of a wedge) visible on the TV, the routine will ask
      the user to position the cursor on any part of the image he
      wishes labeled and then to press any button.  The coordinates,
      but not the labels, will appear on top of the image if there is
      not enough room on the outside.  Maps may be labeled with
      TVLABEL, not TVWLABEL.

  LTYPE.......Label type: value used is 7 but the adverb value in the
              hundreds part is honored to control metric scaling.

              yellow, 2 the previously familiar green, 3 pink, 4 cyan,
