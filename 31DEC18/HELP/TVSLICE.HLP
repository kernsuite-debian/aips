TVSLICE
Type: Verb
Use:  TVSLICE will display a SL file directly to a TV graphics plane
      without going through a plot file.  It erases the specified
      graphics plane, labels the plot, and then draws the slice data.
      TVASLICE draws slice data without the erasure and labeling.

      This verb name used to set the end points for SLICE
      interactively.  That function was renamed SETSLICE in 31DEC00.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name (name).        Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name (class).       Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name (seq. #).      0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk unit #.              0 => any.
  INVERS......Version # of SL file.     0 => highest version #
  LTYPE.......Labelling type, see HELP LTYPE for details:
              1 = border, 2 = no ticks, 3 or 7 = standard, 4 or 8 =
              relative to ref. pixel, 5 or 9 = relative to subimage
              (BLC, TRC) center, 6 or 10 = pixels.  7-10 all labels
              other than tick numbers and axis type are omitted.
              Add n * 100 to alter the metric scaling.
  PIXRANGE....Min,Max of Image intensity.  0 => entire range of
              the slice (not the image).
  BDROP.......No of slice pts to omit from beginning of plot.
  EDROP.......No of slice points to omit from end of plot.
              Note that these are points in the slice not pixels in
              the original image.  Use INEXT='SL'; EXTLIST to see how
              many points are in the slice.
  GRCHAN......TV graphics plane to use.  <= 0 -> 1
