DOSTOKES
Type:  Adverb     (Logical,  > 0  =>  true)
Use:   Selects options related to polarization such as conversion from
       VLA polarizations to true Stokes parameters or flagging across
       polarizations.
Null value:  false (-1).
Tasks:
  DEFLG......Flags uv data based on decorrelation of the data over
             time.  DOSTOKES true means to flag all polarizations when
             one is bad.
  FLAGR......Flags data based on internal RMS, amplitudes, weights.
             DOSTOKES controls which Stokes are flagged when a bad
             point is found.
  SNFLG......Flags uv data based on jumps in an SN or CL table.
             DOSTOKES true means to flag all polarizations when one is
             bad.
