EPOSWTCH
Type: Verb
Use:  EPOSWTCH may be used to swithc the epoch of the coordinates in the
      image or UV header from B1950 (or whatever) to J2000 and back to
      B1950.  The conversion is of adequate accuracy for normal imaging
      but should not be used in astrometric circumstances.  The
      conversion assumes that it may be represented by a shift of the
      coordinates of the reference pixel and a slight rotation.  This is
      not correct at the highest accuracies.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......Image name(name).       Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name(class).      Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name(seq. #).     0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk drive # of image.  0 => any.
