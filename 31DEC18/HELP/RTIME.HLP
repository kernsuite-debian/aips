RTIME:  Task to test compute times
NCOUNT           0.0               Number of 2-millions of ops

RTIME
Type:  Task
Use:   RTIME is used to relative computer performance.  It does
       3 operations in floating point and then repeats them in
       integer.  Each operation has an outer loop repeated
       NCOUNT times and an inner loop repeated 2000000 times.
       The 1st and 4th loops are simple sums of a constant.  The
       2nd and 5th loops are sums of
           RSUM  =  RSUM  +  CONSTA  -  RSUM / CONSTB
       and the 3rd and 6th loops are sums of the form
        RSUM = RSUM - RSUM/CONSTB + ARRAY(i) + ARRAY(2000000-i)
Adverbs:
  NCOUNT.....The numbers of 2-millions of ops.  <= 0 => 50.
