LTYPE
Type: Adverb  (Real)
Use:  Set up the type of label to be used on a plot.
         LTYPE has 3 parts: sign * [ 100 * n + m ]

      Values of m mean:
       1 = No label, just a border line
       2 = No tick labels, just tick marks and rest of label

       3 = Label with RA and DEC or other natural units
       4 = Label in arcsec or other units from reference pixel
       5 = Label in arcsec or other units from subimage center
       6 = Label in pixels from original bottom left corner

      Do just tick numbers and X and Y axis labels, leaving of
      the time, source name, center coordinates, peak flux, and
      other labels:
       7 = Label with RA and DEC or other natural units
       8 = Label in arcsec or other units from reference pixel
       9 = Label in arcsec or other units from subimage center
      10 = Label in pixels from original bottom left corner

      Values of n mean:
       0 = Metric scaling on non-coordinate axes (micro, milli, kilo,
           mega, et al.) meant to make range visible
       1 = Same except that milli and kilo are not used
       2 = Same as 1 except micro and mega are also not used
       3 = Move each metric scale one closer to none
       4 = Move each metric scale one or two closer to none

      Negative LTYPE means the same as the corresponding
      positive value, but asks the plot routine to suppress the
      date/time/plot-version-number label.

Null Value:  0 => 3 in most places
