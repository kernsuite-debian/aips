# TPDEVS.LIST
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a list file containing a list of AIPS tape devices.  You
# should edit this and insert one line for each physical tape drive in
# your AIPS network.  The order of appearance in this file determines
# which is TAPE1, TAPE2, etc.
#
# When specifying devices, be careful to specify the CORRECT device
# name.  See the architecture-specific descriptions below for additional
# details.  The AIPS ZMOUN2.C routines in the various architecture-
# specific directories WILL MODIFY THE DEVICE NAME USED, and furthermore
# will assume you have specified the lowest density NO-REWIND device.
# Read the ZMOUN2.C for your architecture before making any assumptions
# or changes!
#
# NOTE!  QIC drives cannot be used by AIPS directly as they cannot back
# space over files.
#
# ALPHA:  Device names /dev/nrmtxd where x is from 0 to 31 and d is the
#         density, one of a, l, m, or h.  As "a" only applies to QIC
#         drives, ignore it.  The others are "l" for low density, "m"
#         for medium, and "h" for high.  Be wary of drives that
#         implement possibly non-portable compression algorithms via the
#         higher densities... check your manual pages on mtio, tz, and
#         tape drive vendor documentation.
#
# CVEX:   Device name /dev/rmtxx, xx=0,1,2,3 for drive number.  Density
#         default is 800 BPI; add 8 for 1600, 16 for 6250.  Add 4 for
#         norewind-on-close.  AIPS KNOWS ABOUT THIS so just define them
#         as /dev/rmtxx, LITERALLY!
#
# DEC:    See ALPHA above.  Rules are the same.
#
# HP:     See SOL below.
#
# IBM:    Device name /dev/rmtx[.y], x=0,1,2,3,... drive number; y=1 for
#         norewind-on-close, high density; 5 for norewind-on-close, low
#         density.  Just specify the required part and let AIPS fill in
#         the density bit, e.g. /dev/rmt0 for the first tape drive.
#
# LINUX:  Starting with 1.2 or thereabouts, the usual name for tape
#         devices on Linux is /dev/nstx, where x is the drive number
#         0,1,2, etc.  The "n" indicates no-rewind.  Many installations
#         also include /dev/nrst0, /dev/nrst1, etc. as symlinks for
#         compatibility with SunOS 4 applications.
#
# SGI:    Initially thought to be identical to SOL/HP, but there may be
#         differences.  Uncharted waters... Tread with caution.
#
# SUN:    Device name /dev/nrstx, x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 drive number.  Here
#         n MUST be included for norewind device.  AIPS knows about the
#         density conversions (adding 8, 16, or 24 to x) and will do
#         this automatically depending on the DENSITY adverb.  So, just
#         use the basic number from 0 to 7.  This applies for SCSI
#         devices only.
#
# SOL:    Device name /dev/rmt/xd[n], x is 0,1,2,.. drive number, d is
#         density, one of l, m, or h for for low, medium, high, and n
#         (literally) means norewind (mandatory for AIPS).  ZMOUN2.C
#         will put the correct density setting in "d"; specify "l" as
#         the initial value.  DO NOT USE THE BERKELEY STYLE DEVICES like
#         /dev/nrstx; these WILL NOT WORK.  Also do not add a "b" to the
#         /dev/rmt/xdn device name: use, e.g. /dev/rmt/0ln for tape
#         zero, and NOT /dev/rmt/0lnb.
#
# The host name MUST be in the first column.  Make sure the last line
# has a terminating newline, and MAKE SURE EACH DEFINED TAPE HAS A
# NON-BLANK COMMENT!!!
