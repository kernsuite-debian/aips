Self-cal gain solution files         GAdssvv
 
 
A. Overview
 
Function: This extension file for a uv data set contains the
gains resulting from ASCAL.
 
Details: GA files use the EXTINI-EXTIO file structure.  With the
rescaling factor in the file header.  The logical record
length is 256 words
 
Names: The file name is GAdsssvv where d is disk number, sss=catalog
number and vv = version number.
 
B.  File structure.
 
 
    The file header record contains the following:
 
    Location
Location  Size            Description
  255      R      GM=mean gain modulus.
 
   Logical record structure.
 
   Location
  Addr  Size   Name          Description
    1    CX    GAIN(28,2)    IF gains
  113    I     IFLG(2)       Packed logical IF flags 1st 28=IF 1,
                             2nd 28=IF 2.
  115    I     BFLG(24)      Packed logical baseline flags,
                             1st 378 = IF 1, next 378 = IF 2.
                             The order number for baseline i-j
                             is j - 28 + i(55 - i)/2
  139    I     KV            Last vis number in the time range.
  140    R     T1            Start time of solution interval.
                             NOTE: times are in seconds.
  141    R     T2            End time of solution interval.
  142    I     IREF(2)       Reference antenna for the 2 IFs.
  144    I     GACAL(28,2,2) (ant, if, 1) = Tsys (used by VBANT)
                             (ant, if, 2) = Tant
 
 
C. User notes.
 
     When calling EXTINI use LREC=256.
 
 
D.  Routines to write GA files:
     EXTINI and EXTIO,  GA files are currently written by ASCAL.
 
 
E.  Routines to access GA files: EXTINI and EXTIO.
