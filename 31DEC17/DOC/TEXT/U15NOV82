Updating instructions for 15-Nov-1982 release

IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.

Principles:  This update is a large one involving the conversion
from two separate directories, TEST and AIPS, to one directory
with lots of subdirectories.  These instructions assume that the
15-Sep-1982 version was installed and that there really are the
2 standard areas on your machine.  I will call the disk drives
MXA0:, MXA1:, and MXA2: - substitute the correct names and
number of disks for your system.

The instructions call for you to create some of the subdirectories
which you will need.  The rest will be created by the installation
procedures.  Almost all data files are preserved, but the TGET
files must be destroyed due to a format change.  The data files
must be renamed to the new data areas and the protections reset
to allow full group access.

1. Run PRTACC on [TEST] to get the final accounting for this area.

2. Login to AIPS:
     a. CREATE /DIRECTORY MXA0:[AIPS.DATA]
     b. CREATE /DIRECTORY MXA1:[AIPS.DATA]
     c. CREATE /DIRECTORY MXA2:[AIPS.DATA]
     d. CREATE /DIRECTORY MXA0:[AIPS.15NOV82]

3. Login to TEST
     a. Do @SPACE to get a full list of users who have data in
        TEST on the 3 disks.
     b. For each user in MXA0:[TEST]:
            RENAME MXA0:[TEST]*.???;1  MXA0:[AIPS.DATA]*
        where ??? is the user number.
     c. For each user in MXA1:[TEST]:
            RENAME MXA1:[TEST]*.???;1  MXA1:[AIPS.DATA]*
        where ??? is the user number.
     d. For each user in MXA2:[TEST]:
            RENAME MXA2:[TEST]*.???;1  MXA2:[AIPS.DATA]*
        where ??? is the user number.
     e. SET PROT=(S:RE,O:RWED,G:RWED,W:RE) MXA0:[AIPS.DATA]*.*.*
     f. SET PROT=(S:RE,O:RWED,G:RWED,W:RE) MXA1:[AIPS.DATA]*.*.*
     g. SET PROT=(S:RE,O:RWED,G:RWED,W:RE) MXA2:[AIPS.DATA]*.*.*
     h. DEL MXA0:[TEST]ME*.;1
     i. DEL MXA0:[TEST]TS*.*;1

4. Login to AIPS and do installation following instructions.

   After executing ILOAD and before doing IBUILD be sure to edit the
command procedures [AIPS]ILINKAP.COM and [AIPS]ILINKAN.COM to make the
AP libraries the same as yours.

5. Cleaning up.

   Rename [AIPS]OAIPSTR.COM to [AIPS]AIPSTR.COM and [AIPS]OAIPS.COM to
[AIPS]AIPS.COM.  These routines contain a patch to allow the old AIPS
version (without the new directory structure) to still be run as the
OLD version.

   Add @MXA0:[AIPS]ASSIGNL to the system startup procedure to allow
the new group logical assignments to be made at boot time.  These names
do not conflict with the old logical names, so you can keep the old
logical names around as long as you are running an OLD version with the
old directory structure.

   Edit NEW:ASSIGNP.COM and change the disk names UMAx: to MXAx:.
