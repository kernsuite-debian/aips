Updating instructions for 15-Jan-1983 release


IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.

Principles:  This update is fairly straightforward but not totally
trivial.  The catalog header format was changed and the format of
Clean Components extension files was changed.  These instructions
assume that the 15-Nov-1982 version was installed.  If you have
not installed 15-Nov-1982 see the instructions for that update.
You can follow those instructions using the 15-Jan-83 tape in
step 4.  Then go to step 2 below.  Most programs in the OLD area
will not work because of the file format changes.  The safest
course is to have both OLD and NEW logical names point to the NEW
area until the next update.

     All files may be preserved if you choose.  The SAVE / GET files
will lack some new verbs and adverbs, however.  No serious problems 
should arise from keeping them.

1. Install the new system software.

2. Run the correction program CATCHL for the catalog format:
     a. RUN [AIPS.15JAN83.LOAD]CATCHL
     b. Answer the question with range of disk numbers 
        and user numbers.

3. Run the correction program CATCHC for the clean component format:
     a. RUN [AIPS.15JAN83.LOAD]CATCHC
     b. Answer the question with range of disk numbers 
        and user numbers.

4. Don't forget any special user-owned demountable packs.
   The programs CATCHL and CATCHC can be run on single packs.
