Chapter I. Getting Started with AIPS


     The following description is designed for users of AIPS who
wish to know as little as possible yet use the system reasonably
efficiently and sensibly.  This description in no way replaces the
more detailed chapters which follow.

     AIPS, Astronomical Image Processing System, is the name of some
computer software which enables a user to perform a wide range of
reduction, analysis, and display functions on astronomical data.  This
description will be organized as follows:

    A.  How to start AIPS on the VAX and MODCOMP computers
    B.  How to run programs
    C.  Finding information in AIPS
    D.  A list of the current software
    E.  A little about the mapnames, files etc.

A.  How to start AIPS on the VAX and MODCOMP computers


     1.  On the VAX

         a)  Find a terminal connected to the VAX - the one closest
                to the TV monitor is best.

         b)  Hit RETURN key which is denoted by (CR)
                If response is <Username:> go to c)
                If response is <$>
                   type <LO>,CR; another CR; then go to c)
                If response is anything else
                   type <CNTR Y>,CR; <LO>,CR; another CR;

         c)  Type <AIPS>,CR immediately after <Username:>
                response is <Password:>

         d)  Type <AIPS>,CR immediately after <Password:>
                (your typing will not appear on the screen)
                response is <Welcome to VAX/VMS ...>

         e)  Type <@AIPS>,CR
                response is <BEGIN THE ONE TRUE AIPS NUMBER #>
                            <AIPS: ENTER USER ID NUMBER>
                            <?>

         f)  Type <your user number>,CR after the ? prompt.
                response is a prompt >
                you are now in AIPS.  GOOD LUCK.

         g)  The 4025 Tektronix terminals use the RUB OUT key
             (upper right of main keyboard) for backspacing.
             <CNTR S> will stop the scroll, <CNTR Q> will begin it.
             <CNTR Y> will abort AIPS

     2.  On the MODCOMP

         a)  Find the terminal connected to the MODCOMP which
                is closest to the TV monitor.

         b)  Type <JOB>,CR
                If response is <$>
                   type <AIPS>,CR and go to c)
                For any other response
                   Type <CNTR A>,CR,</U/ACT 255 BM>,CR
                      $ is the response, then
                   Type <CNTR A>,CR,</U/A>,CR
                      ABORT......
                      $ is the response, then
                   Type <AIPS>,CR

         c)  To response of <AIPS: ENTER USER ID NUMBER>
                type <user number>,CR
                you are now in AIPS.  GOOD LUCK.

         d)  The 4025 Tektronix terminals use the BK TAB-BK SPC
             key (two keys to the right of the 'P') for backspacing.

B.  How to run programs


     Program operations can be initiated in several ways.  First,
typing a verb keyword defined in AIPS will initiate an operation.
The input and output parameters associated with the verb are stored in
adverb keywords which can be set by the user before invoking the verb.
Some verbs use input arguments as well as adverbs to set the
necessary parameters.  Verbs are executed within AIPS and the user
must wait until the verb has completed its action before continuing.

     A task is similar to a verb in that it causes an operation to
take place.  However, once the task is started, it is shed from AIPS
and the facilities of AIPS are available to the user.  Input para-
meters to tasks are set with adverbs.  A task is invoked by setting
<TASK='Task name'>,CR; then <GO>,CR

     Pseudo verbs are verbs which initiate action but require special
processing.  Most of these keywords are associated with utility
routines and procedure building processes.

C.  Finding information in AIPS


     Much of the documentation of AIPS can be displayed on the
computer terminal by typing HELP followed by any keyword or other
appropriate word.


     1.  Type <HELP>
              This will produce a list of the HELP files in AIPS.
              The HELP files are of three types:
                  Listing of the AIPS vocabulary
                  Description of each verb, task or adverb
                  Grouping of AIPS software

     2.  Type <HELP VERBS>
              The entire list of verbs (words which initiate some
              operation to take place) is given.  The more orderly
              listing of these verbs is given below.

     3.  Type <HELP (any verb)>
              This will give much more information about the use of the
              verb and the list of adverbs (input parameters) needed
              by the verb.

     4.  Type <HELP TASKS>
              The entire list of tasks is given.

     5.  Type <HELP (any task)>
              This will give much more information about the use of the
              task and the list of adverbs needed.

     6.  Type <HELP (any adverb)>
              This will give inormation on the specified adverb.


     Another way to get assistance is INPUTS.  This will list
which adverbs go with a specified task or verb, what their current
values are, and what they do (briefly).  The format is

     1.  Type  <INPUTS (any task)>

     2.  Type  <INPUTS (any verb)>

for this facility.

E.  A little about mapnames, files, etc.


     Most of the software in AIPS deals with arrays or images.  The
images may have any number of dimensions from 1 through 7, although
a number of the algorithms will work only on a two-dimensional plane
within the image.  Typical axes are RA, Dec, Frequency, and Stokes.
Each image is contained on one disk in one file.

     The physical name of the mapfile is generated internally and is
of no concern to the user.  The user selects an image by specifying
an image designation which contains three parts:

          Name    A string of up to 12 legal characters.
          Class   A string of up to 6 legal characters.
          Seq     A number between 0 and 9999

Each of these parts of the image designation corresponds to separate
adverb keywords.  Sometimes the entire image designation is printed as
<Name.Class.Seq> for simplicity.   The image designation can be
chosen arbitrarily by the user.  However, many programs can choose or
set intelligently some or all parts of the image designation.

     Only the map array data, in the form of 2-byte integers, are stored
in the mapfile.  The header information is stored in a special file
called the Catalog File.  Each disk has a catalog file which contains
all of the headers for the images on that disk.  The catalog files
also contain index records to the headers and keep track of which maps
are being read and/or written.

     Extension files may be associated with any mapfile.  These files
contain the processing history of the map, the components subtracted
from the map, spectral-channel information, plotting information, and
the like.  The user may obtain access to these files by specifying
the image designation (name, class, seq), the extension file type
(e.g. 'HI' for history files, 'PL' for plot files), and the version
number.  At the present time, there are no verbs or tasks except
DELEXT which require the specification of an extension file type.

     Array elements in an image are designated by their pixel values.
If M(i,j,k,l) represent such an array, the first element in M is
M(1,1,1,1) with the indices incrementing fastest on the left.  For
two-dimensional images, the (1,1) element will be normally associated
with the lower left hand corner pixel; the first index associated
with the row and the second with the column.  Rectangular arrays are
specified by the user by the two adverbs

   BLC  (Bottom Left Corner)     i pixel value,j pixel value
   TRC  (Top Right Corner)       i pixel value,j pixel value

BLC and TRC have been generalized to cover 7-dimensional maps with the
obvious extension in their use.



     An adverb value is global.  Its value is associated with all
verbs and tasks which use it unless changed by the user.  The default
value for any adverb, then, is the last value specified.  Many adverbs
have null values which instruct the software to pick reasonable values
for them on execution.  For example, if a user reads a map from tape
to disk (TASK='IMLOD'), he should specify the image designation of the
output map (name,class and seq).  If these adverbs have null values
(usually zero or blank, see HELPs for details), IMLOD automatically
choses the source name for the image name, some suitable combination
of (I,Q,U,V) and (MAP,BEM,CLN,RES) for the image class, and 1 for the
image seq.  If this leads to a duplication with an existing image desig-
nation on that disk, the seq is incremented until the new image name is
unique.

F.  Some AIPS examples


     For best results the following demonstration should be done at a
terminal, step by step.  It is assumed that the steps in part A, to
bring up AIPS, have been done successfully.


     All of the verbs, tasks and adverbs will be completely spelled
out in the following examples.  The parser using minimum matching,
however, so that only the characters need be typed which uniquely
specifies the keyword.  For example <GET2NAME> is unambiguous if
<GET2> is typed.  If the string is not unique, an error message will
be generated.



   EXAMPLE 1.  The verb CATALOG

>GO                               Begin execution of PRTIM

     During execution of PRTIM several things will occur.  First,
AIPS will resume while PRTIM is thinking.  You are now free to use
AIPS to do whatever you like, including running another task or
another verb.  Also, the small terminal on top of the IIS display will
inform you about the progress of the task.  Finally, the line printer
will spew out the digital listing of the map when PRTIM is finished.




   EXAMPLE 4.  Making a grey-scale plot


    Terminal input                    Comments

>GETNAME(2)                       Get image in slot 2

>TASK='PRTPL';GO                  Run task PRTPL to make the plot

     Notice that all of the adverbs, save the input image designation,
were used in their null value.

G.  Writing and using procedures


     Procedures are POPS language subroutines which are normally
written by the user at run time in order to avoid repeated typing of
frequently used sequences.  The POPS language has the verbs and
pseudoverbs (marked by *'s) listed below:

     In addition to this basic POPS vocabulary, any of the verbs,
pseudoverbs, adverbs and tasks listed in section D are also part of
the entire AIPS vocabulary.  Some of the trivial uses of the POPS
language are

>PRINT (2+5*6)
>PRINT 'X= ',ATAN(1.0)/3.14159*180
>FOR I = 1 TO 5 BY 1;GETNAME(I);IMDEST;END

These expressions must fit on one line.

    More powerful are the use of real procedures.  See Chapter II,
Section D for the details.  As an example, let's write a procedure to
get a map from the Nth slot in the catalog file, to display this map
on the TV, and to print it on the line printer.  While PRTIM is in
execution, the procedure pseudocolors the TV image.

   Terminal input                      Comments

>PROC MCOLOR(N)                     This statement says we wish to
                                      build a PROC MCOLOR with para-
                                      meter N.
:GETNAME(N)                         Get the image designation in slot
                                      N.  Note the prompt : when in
                                      procedure building mode.
:TVOFF(1234);TVON(1)                Turn image channels 1,2,3 and 4
                                      off, then turn channel 1 on
:TVCHAN=1;TVLOD                     Load image in image channel 1
:TASK='PRTIM'                       Set task to PRTIM
:XINC=5;YINC=5;GO                   Print every fifth pixel
:TVPSEUDO                           Do pseudocoloring
:RETURN ;FINISH                     Ends the procedure building mode.
                                      Returns back to AIPS

Proc editting capabilities are described in Chapter II, Section D.

     To use this procedure, simply type MCOLOR(2).  The image in
Catalog slot 2 will then be loaded into the IIS and the task PRTIM will
begin printing it.  Then AIPS turns on the cursor and types instruc-
tions on the terminal for the functions controlled by the cursor.  The
user may move the cursor with the trackball and press buttons A, B,
and/or C until the desired coloring is obtained.  When button D is hit,
control returns from the proc and AIPS prompts for input with > .
Thus, this type of procedure facility enables the user to define verb-
like keywords for useful reduction ensembles.  This facility should be
especially powerful for spectral line reductions when repetitive
operations will be done on a large set of images.

     A problem with procedures is that they become part of the AIPS
baggage and the addition of a large number of procedures can burden
the system.  Also, procedures are lost when a person EXITs or when he
restores the initial values in AIPS.  They can be saved in RUN files
which will be described in Section I.

H.  Using the batch capabilities


     Submitting a job to the batch processor is straight-forward.  Any
set of statements which does not need immediate interaction by the user
can be run in batch.  This excludes all TV, green screen, and tape
drive use.  Greater detail on batch may be found in Chapter II, Section
G.  A brief example is given here.

   EXAMPLE.  We wish to print a map in digital form on the line printer
Let's use the same example as EXAMPLE 3 in Section F.

     Terminal input                       Comments

>BATQUE=1;BATCLEAR                Set Batch queue to 1 and clear
>BATCH                            Enter batch mode

<GETNAME(2)                       Notice '<' prompt.
<INPUTS PRTIM
<BLC=50,50;TRC=150,130
<NDIG=2;XINC=3;YINC=XINC          We have not included all of the
<TASK='PRTIM'                       steps in EXAMPLE 3 since some do
<GO                                 not make sense in a batch mode
<ENDBATCH                           Exit from batch mode

>                                   Return of AIPS prompt

Editing capabilites are again given in Chapter II, Section G.  To
submit the job to the job queue simply type <SUBMIT> and it will run in
its own turn.  All output will be listed on the line printer.  Job
interrogation, removing jobs from the queue, etc can be done in AIPS.
When a job is submitted it first must pass through a program called
RANCC which tests for a variety of errors in the batch file.  The job
is submitted for batch processing only if no errors are found.

      Jobs in BATQUE=1 run with somewhat higher priority than jobs in
BATQUE=2.  Users are encouraged to use the former only for relatively
short jobs and the latter for longer jobs.  At present, there are only
two batch queues allowed.

I.  Run files


     AIPS has no capability for permanent storage of procedures,
favorite adverb values, and batch files.  Some temporary storage
during a session is accomodated by the STORE and RESTORE pseudoverbs.

     Any set of commands which can be typed on the terminal can be
stored in a text file.  At the present time the computer's text editor
must be used to generate the file.  The text file contains the
statements that one would type on the terminal and the files are
stored in special RUN areas in the computers.

     To access the file the user types, when in AIPS control,
RUN STUFF, where STUFF in the name of the text file in the Run
area of the computer.  This text will then be executed.  These
files can be complete procedures or batch programs.  An example is
given below.

     To generate a text file on the VAX, do the following

     1)  Exit from AIPS by typing EXIT
     2)  type LO after the $ prompt
     3)  Hit return key
     4)  Respond with RUN after Username:
     5)  Respond with RUN after Password:
     6)  Type EDIT STUFF to get into text editor
     7)  Build up text file as desired.  The text editor on the
         VAX is very similar to that in the DEC-10
     8)  Example
         GETNAME(2)
         IMHEADER
         TASK='PRTIM'
         XINC=5;YINC=XINC
         GO
     9)  Escape from text editor by hitting ESC
    10)  Catalog file by typing E
    11)  type LO to get out of run area

     To use this file, first get back into AIPS by following
direction in Section I.  Then simply type RUN STUFF to execute the
above instructions.  The header of the second map in the catalog
will be listed on the terminal and the map will be printed on
the line printer.

J.  Miscellaneous


   1.  Mounting a tape

        See directions on how to mount a tape given on the doors on
        the VAX tape drive and the MODCOMP tape drives.  On the VAX,
        one must also mount the tape drive in software.  This is done
        in monitor mode (prompt $) before typing @AIPS.
        Type <@MOUNT>.  Then type @AIPS.  To dismount simply logoff
        <LO> or in monitor mode type <DISMOUNT MTA0:>.  The MODCOMP
        does not need any JCL software for tape useage.

   2.  If the line printer goes wild, kill it by

        a) On the VAX
              Turn of line-printer
              Exit from AIPS.  Save anything you might want.
              With $ prompt type <SHOW QUEUE LPA0>
              Find Job number shown on terminal
              type <DELETE/ENTRY=<job number> LPA0>
              Turn on Line-printer and go back to AIPS
        b) On the MODCOMP
              Type CTRL A
              Type /S/A

    3.  Log files

        Log files, which contain lots of information about your session
        on the terminal, are stored as you work.  It is useful to print
        these out if you have experienced troubles or if you wish to
        have a record of what you've done.  To get such a listing type
        the verb PRTMSG.  You must first set the adverb PRIORITY to an
        appropriate value.  If PRIORITY=0 you get everything you did
        except HELP-like messages.  PRIORITY=3 will leave out typing
        and INPUTS and other less interesting things.  PRIORITY=11 will
        clear out your messages without generating any significant
        printout.

    4.  SAVE, GET, STORE and RESTORE files

        There are two ways to store your AIPS environment; that is,
        all of the adverb values and procedure definitions.  For
        temporary storeage type <STORE n> where n = 1,2,3,4 or 5.
        The command <RESTORE n> will fetch the environment.
        STORE and RESTORE should not be used for permanent storeage
        since each user has access to these areas.  The command
        <RESTORE 0> will initialize the AIPS environment.

        For permanent storeage the following commands should be used
               <SAVE *#>  where * is any letter from A to Y
                                # is any number from 1 to 4
        To get the AIPS environment type
               <GET  *#>
        These files are associated with your user number and are
        permanent.  Use the command <SAVDEST> to delete your
        SAVE files.
