Source table         SUdssvv
 
 

Details:
 
A. Overview
 
   This extension table for a uv data set contains relevant information
about the sources in a raw uv data file.  This includes positions.

 
Names: The file name is SUdsssvv where d is disk number, sss=catalog
number and vv = version number.
 
B.  File structure.

     Each logical record consists of the position and other information
about a source in the raw uv data file.  Sources are distinguished in
the data file by a source ID number.

     For moving sources the apparent position is for 0 hours IAT on the
reference day defined in the subarray AN file.  The motion from this
position is given by PMRA and PMDEC.
 
 
    The file header record contains the following KEYWORDs:
 
     Keyword  code     Description
   ---------- ----     ---------------------------------------------------
     NO_IF     I       The number of IF pairs.
     VELTYP    A       Velocity type, 8 char, 'LSR','BARYCENT',
                       'GEOCENTR','TOPOCENT'
     VELDEF    A       Velocity defination, 8 char, 'RADIO' or 'OPTICAL'

C. User notes.

  The "code" column is element_count + basic type code.
basic type codes: D=Double precision, E=single precision,
   A=character, J=long integer, L=logical, I=short integer, X=bit.

      Note 1.  Entries with dimensions marked '*' are arrays whose
dimension is given by the header keyword NO_IF.

     The true frequency of the observations are the signed sums of the
reference frequency in the catalogue header, the peculiar source frequency
offset from this table and the IF frequency offset from the IF table
(CH file).
