Self-cal gain solution files         GNdssvv
 
 
A. Overview
 
Function: This extension file for a uv data set contains the
gains resulting from ASCAL.
 
Details: GN files use the EXTINI-EXTIO file structure.  With the
rescaling factor in the file header.  The logical record
length is 512 I*2 words
 
Names: The file name is GNdsssvv where d is disk number, sss=catalog
number and vv = version number. 
 
B.  File structure.
 
 
    The file header record contains the following:
 
    Location
  I*2  R*4   Size            Description
  255  128   R*4     GM=mean gain modulus.
 
   Logical record structure.
 
   Location
  I*2    Size  Name          Description
    1  CX*8    GAIN(28,2)    IF gains
  225   I*2    IFLG(4)       Packed logical IF flags 1st 28=IF 1,
                             2nd 28=IF 2.
  229   I*2    BFLG(48)      Packed logical baseline flags,
                             1st 378 = IF 1, next 378 = IF 2.
                             The order number for baseline i-j
                             is j - 28 + i(55 - i)/2
  277   I*4    KV            Last vis number in the time range.
  279   R*4    T1            Start time of solution interval in days.
  281   R*4    T2            End time of solution interval.
  283   I*2    IREF(2)       Reference antenna for the 2 IFs.
  285   I*2    SPARE(228)    Spare words.
 
 
C. User notes.
 
     When calling EXTINI use BP=2, LREC=512.
 
 
D.  Routines to write GN files:
     EXTINI and EXTIO,  GN files are currently written by ASCAL.
 
 
E.  Routines to access GN files: EXTINI and EXTIO.
