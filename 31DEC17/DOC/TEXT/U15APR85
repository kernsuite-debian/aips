Updating instructions for 15APR85 release (Save/Get ver 7).
 
 
IGNORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE AN OLD AIPS
RUNNING THAT YOU WANT TO CONVERT TO THE NEW FORMAT.
 
Principles:  This update involves no file structure changes over the
15OCT84 release.  All files may be preserved if you choose.
 
   If your current system is a 15OCT84 release, it
will be possible to have an OLD and a NEW area.  In this case your
current NEW area will become your OLD area.  Just enter the name you
are using for your current release (probably 15OCT84) when the update
procedure prompts for the OLD area.
 
   If your current system is older than 15OCT84, the file clean component
file structure changes in that release will prevent you from
running an OLD and a NEW since both systems access the same data area.
If you have an older system, you must update your current data files
by following the file structure update instructions for all releases
that follow your current release.
