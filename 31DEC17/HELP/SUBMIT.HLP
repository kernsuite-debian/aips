----------------------------------------------------------------
SUBMIT
Type: verb
Use: Submits the specified batch work file to the batch checker
     program (AIPSC).  If the checker finds no errors, the contents of
     the work file are moved to a job file and the job is queued to be
     executed by batch AIPS (AIPSB).  Note that the checker expands
     any RUN files during this process.  Thus, after the job has been
     successfully submitted, you may modify the RUN files without harm
     to the job.  The work file is not modified by this process.  The
     checker will delay the job by DETIME, but by at least 1 minute.
     Use QUEUES to see when the job is scheduled to run.
Adverbs:
  BATQUE....The number of the batch work file. Also the job queue to
            which it is to be submitted if submitted to the local
            computer.
  DETIME....The number of hours which should pass before the job is
            actually executed.
  VERSION...Version of AIPSC and AIPSB to be used (i.e. 'NEW' or
            'OLD').  See HELP VERSION for details.
  REMHOST...Computer on the local area net which will run the batch
            job.  AIPSC is run on your machine but the QMNGR and AIPSB
            programs will run on REMHOST.
  REMQUE....Batch queue to use on remote host.  0 -> BATQUE, ignored
            if REMHOST = ' '.
