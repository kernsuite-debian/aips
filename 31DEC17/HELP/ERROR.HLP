ERROR
Type:  Adverb  (scalar)
Use:   Was there an error?  Also used as an estimate of the uncertainty
       in some tasks.
Null value:
       none.  <= 0 => false,   > 0 => true.
       or 0 => task-dependent default
Verbs:
   CHKNAME.....Checks existence of data set or image by name adverbs
   EGETNAME....Gets INNAME et al., setting ERROR true on empty slot.
   IMVAL.......Does cubic interpolation of image value; returns ERROR
               true if fit failed.
   MAXFIT......Finds coordinates and value of an image extremum;
               returns ERROR true if fit failed.
   QIMVAL......Does cubic interpolation of image value quietly; returns
               ERROR true if fit failed.
Procedures:
   TVFLUX......Displays coordinates and values selected with the TV
               cursor; sets ERROR true if cubic interpolation fails.
   TVMAXFIT....Displays fit pixel positions and intensity at maxima on
               TV; returns ERROR true if MAXFIT fails on a position.
Tasks:
   BSMAP.......Images weak sources with closure phases.  ERROR is the
               error per unit weight in Jy.
