UVFIXPRM
Type: Adverb   (Real(20))
Use:  The task specific parameters for UVFIX.  Specifies
      geometry and time information.
Null value:  Usually 0.
Tasks:
  UVFIX  Recomputes u, v, and w with optional tangent point
        shift.
     1 => array type, 0=VLA, 1=VLBI, 2=other.
     2 => array number, 0 => loop over all.
     3+4 => array BX, meters. (proper defaults for UVFIXPRM(1)=
     5+6 => array BY, meters.       0 or 1)
     7+8 => array BZ, meters.
      Here X is in the direction of the intersection of the
      meridian of the reference location (long=0 for earth
      centered) and the equator; Y is 90 deg. EAST along the
      equator from X; Z is in the direction of the N. pole.
      Note that:
         BX = UVFIXPRM(3) + UVFIXPRM(4),
         BY = UVFIXPRM(5) + UVFIXPRM(6),
         BZ = UVFIXPRM(7) + UVFIXPRM(8).
      The addition of two parameters allows the coordinates
      to be specified with more precision than a single adverb
      allows; on a 32-bit machines adverb values are only
      accurate to 7 significant digits.
     11 => UT1-UTC in seconds, no default.
     12 => IAT-UTC in seconds, default = year-1961 which is OK
      until mid-1982 when after which it is off 1 (or more)
      second(s). Accurate values for both UT1-UTC and
      IAT-UTC can be obtained from USNO Bulletin no. 7.
     13 => Clock error.  This is mostly used for VLA data for
       which the time labels are in error by half of the
       MODCOMP online averaging time. Usually 5 seconds.
       (no default).  The clock error is subtracted from
       times in the file.
     14 => Frequency in Hz. If .LE.0 the value in the AN file
       will be used.
