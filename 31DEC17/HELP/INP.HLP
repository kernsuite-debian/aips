INP       LLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
INP:  Verb-like to display the adverbs of a task, verb, or proc
TASK                               Task, verb, or proc name
DOPRINT                            <= -9 -> no page-full stops
VERSION
                                   Version of task or AIPS to
                                   be (being) run
          Task name may be inserted as an immediate argument
          i.e INP TASK or INP 'TASK'.  The output does not go
          to the message file (unlike INPUTS).
----------------------------------------------------------------
INP
Type:  Pseudoverb
Use:   To display the current values of those adverbs relevant
       to the specified verb or task together with a brief
       description and range test.  This verb is similiar to
       INPUTS but does not write to the log file, thus is faster
       but one can not later obtain a paper copy of the results.
Grammar:   INP  name
       where name is the name of the task or verb for which
       the information is desired.
Adverbs:
   TASK......Used as the name if no name is specified.
   DOPRINT...In normal interactive mode (not batch or RUN), the
             verb pauses at each full CRT page and ask if you wish to
             continue or not.  To suppress this, set DOPRINT = -9 or
             less.
   VERSION...Version of INPUTS file to be used.  See HELP
             VERSION for details.
