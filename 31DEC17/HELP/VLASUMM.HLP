VLASUMM: Prints list of ant. and scans to a file or the screen

VLASUMM
Type:  Procedure
Use:   Prints information about the antennas and the scans in
       a data set to a file, screen or printer.
       Type RUN VLAPROCS to make the VLASUMM procedure
       available.

Adverbs:
  INNAME.....UV file name (name).       Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....UV file name (class).      Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......UV file name (seq. #).     0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk unit #.               0 => any.
  DOCRT......False (<= 0) use the line printer if OUTPRINT = ' '
                   else write named OUTPRINT file only.
             True  (> 0) use the terminal interactively.  The task will
                   use the actual terminal width as a display limit
                   unless 72 < DOCRT < width.  In that case, the display
                   limit will be DOCRT characters.
  OUTPRINT...Disk file name in which to save the line printer output.
             ' ' => use scratch and print immediately for interactive
             jobs - batch jobs use OUTPRINT = 'PRTFIL:BATCHjjj.nnn'
             (jjj= job #, nnn = user #).  When OUTPRINT is not blank,
             multiple outputs are concatenated, and the file is not
             actually printed.

VLASUMM is a procedure which is part of VLAPROCS.  To make
VLASUMM available type RUN VLAPROCS.

Steps in VLASUMM:

1. Run PRTAN over each antenna table.

2. Run LISTR.  Using OPTYPE='SCAN' everything else default
   or input.
