QCREATE
Type: Adverb  (Real)
Use:  Controls how files > 1 Mbyte are created.  If <= 0, the files
      are created on disk by filling the entire requested space with
      zeros.  This guarantees that the disk space is reserved and
      initialized but can take a long time for files of many Gbytes.
      If > 0, files are created by writing a buffer or 2 of zeros at
      the requested end of file so that the file will appear to be as
      big as desired.  However, the parts not filled with zeros are
      not reserved and might not be available when the task gets
      around to writing them.  It also trusts all AIPS programs to
      not assume that the disk is zero to begin with.  The up side of
      this method is that it is very fast and, if you have lots of
      disk space, the danger of running out is minimal.

      This parameter is used on all file creations - effectively it is
      an adverb to the pseudo-verb GO.
