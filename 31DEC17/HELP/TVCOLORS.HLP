Type: Procedure
Use: TVCOLORS sets the LWPLA adverbs DOCOLOR to 1 and PLCOLORS to
     those colors that a task would use when DOTV=1.  This procedure
     will work only if you have an AIPS TV running.  If you want to
     set PLCOLORS when the TV is not running type
        PLCOLORS = 1,1,0, 0.063,1,0, 1,.671,1, 0,1,1
        PLCOLORS(1,9) ~ 1,1,0
     or invoke thee procedure DEFCOLOR.
Adverbs (input):
  GRCHAN......TV graphics channel 1-7, or 0 meaning graphics channel n
              for line type n, n = 1-4.
Output adverbs:
  DOCOLOR.....Set to 1.0 to tell LWPLA to use PLCOLORS.
  PLCOLORS....If GRCHAN > 0, line types 1-4 and 9 (external
              characters) are set to the color of GRCHAN.
              If GRCHAN = 0, line types 1-4 are set to the colors of
              graphics channels 1-4, resp. and line type 9 is set to
              the color of graphics channel 1.  Black lines (types
              5-8) and the background (10) are set to 0 (black).
              See HELP PLCOLORS for further information and an example.
