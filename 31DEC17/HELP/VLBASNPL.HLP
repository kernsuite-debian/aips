VLBASNPL
Type:  Procedure
Use:   Plots selected calibration data versus time from a specified SN
       or CL table to the TV.
       Type RUN VLBAUTIL to make the VLBASNPL procedure
       available.

Adverbs:
  INNAME.....UV file name (name).       Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....UV file name (class).      Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......UV file name (seq. #).     0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk unit #.               0 => any.
  INEXT......'SN' or 'CL' table to be plotted, ''=>'CL'
  INVERS.....Version number of table to plot, 0=>highest no.
  SOURCES....Source list.  '*' = all; a "-" before a source name means
             all except ANY source named.
  TIMERANG...Time range of the data to be plotted. In order: Start day,
             hour, min. sec, end day, hour, min. sec. Days relative to
             reference date.
  STOKES.....The desired Stokes type of the displayed data:
             'R' = RCP, 'L' = LCP, 'RL' or 'RRLL' both RCp and LCP
             'DIFF' = difference between RCP and LCP.
             'RATO' = ratio between RCP and LCP - done for amplitudes,
             system and antenna temperatures, and SNRs only.
  SUBARRAY...Limit display to specific subarray.  -1 -> all, 0 -> 1.
  OPTYPE.....Data to be plotted:
             'PHAS' = phase,
             'AMP ' = amplitude,
             'DELA' = singleband delay
             'RATE' = rate
             'DDLY' = dispersive delay (CL only)
             '    ' => 'PHAS'
             To check the results of VLBACALA set OPTYPE='AMP' and
                   INEXT='CL'
  DOTV.......> 0 => plot directly on the TV device, otherwise make a
             plot file for later display on one or more devices
             (including the TV if desired).

VLBASNPL:           Procedure to examine calibration in SN/CL tables
Documenter:         Amy Mioduszewski
Related Programs:   VLBAUTIL, SNPLT, VLBAFRPL

To check the calibration tables.  This should be done all through
the calibration process but particularly to check the amplitude
corrections after running VLBACALA.

Steps in VLBASNPL:

Runs SNPLT.  If OPTYPE='PHAS' then PIXRA=-180,180.  Sets the
number of plots (NPLOT) to the number of antenna unless this
is greater than 12 then NPLOT=10.
