QIMVAL
Type: Verb
Use: QIMVAL does a cubic interpolation of the image value at the image
     location specified by PIXXY (in pixels) and returns the value in
     PIXVAL and the coordinate in COORDINA.  QIMVAL differs from IMVAL
     only in the fact that it does not report any of its results to
     the terminal or message file.
Adverbs (input):
  INNAME......Image name(name).          Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....Image name(class).         Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......Image name(seq. #).        0 => highest.
  INDISK......Disk drive # of image.     0 => any.
  PIXXY.......(X,Y,...) pixel location in image.  NOT zero
              on the X and Y axes anyway.
  DOCENTER....> 0 => find value at closest pixel to PIXXY
              <= 0 => do a cubic interpolation about PIXXY
Adverbs (output):
  PIXVAL......Intensity at this pixel.
  COORDINA....The X and Y coordinates are found as:
              Xpos = abs(CO(1)) + abs(CO(2))/60 + abs(CO(3))/3600
                 if any of CO(1), CO(2), CO(3) < 0: Xpos = -Xpos
              Ypos = abs(CO(4)) + abs(CO(5))/60 + abs(CO(6))/3600
                 if any of CO(4), CO(5), CO(6) < 0: Ypos = -Ypos
              Note that, although these are most suited to RA, Dec in
              sexagesimal notation, they can be used for any type of
              coordinate.  The units are standard FITS units (e.g
              degrees, m/sec, Hz, sec, etc.) except that right
              ascensions are in hours of time.
  ERROR.......If the verb is not aborted for error, but the
              interpolation fails, ERROR will be TRUE (1), else
              it will be FALSE (-1).
