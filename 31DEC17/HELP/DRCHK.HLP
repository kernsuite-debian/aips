DRCHK
Type: Stand-alone program
Use:  Checks HOSTS.LIST, DADEVS.LIST(.site), NETSP for consistency.

      RUN DRCHK     is the command to start the program.

      It begins by reading in the contents HOSTS.LIST for all sites
      mentioned in the file checking for multiple definitions of the
      same host..  It has room for 500 hosts from each of 6 sites in
      the one file.  It then reads the NETSP file, having room for
      8192 disks, checking for multiple definitions of the same disk.
      It then reads any DADEVS.LIST.<site> files parsing the disk
      names to identify the host and reporting any problems with this.
      For each disk area, it attempts to open the SPACE file which is
      supposed to be located there, reporting failures.  It then
      checks the NETSP list to make sure the disk area is mentioned
      there.  If all sites were not represented by DADEVS.LIST.<site>
      files, DRCHK opens DADEVS.LIST and performs the same checks
      allowing the disk to be listed for any of the sites.  After
      this, it checks to see if any NETSP entries were not represented
      or were multiply represented in the DADEVS.LIST files.  Finally,
      it checks to see if the file $NET0/<HOST_NAME>/ACD000000\; can
      be opened.

      Thus DRCHK confirms that the NETSP, DADEVS.LIST and HOSTS.LIST
      files are consistent and that all areas mentioned therein
      actually exist.  It gives progress messages as it goes as well
      as error messages.  It must be run on a machine capable of
      mounting all disks mentioned.
