TASAV
Task:  To copy all extension files (such as those generated by the
       calibration routines) to a dummy file.  TASAV now works on both
       UV and MA files and will copy extension files other than table
       files (such as PLot files).
Adverbs:
  INNAME.....Input file name (name).      Standard defaults.
  INCLASS....Input file name (class).     Standard defaults.
  INSEQ......Input file name (seq. #).    0 => highest.
  INDISK.....Disk drive # of input file.  0 => any.
  OUTNAME....Output file name (name).     Standard defaults.
  OUTCLASS...Output file name (class).    Standard defaults.
  OUTSEQ.....Output file name (seq. #).   0 => highest unique
  OUTDISK....Disk drive # of output file. 0 => highest with
             space for the file.
