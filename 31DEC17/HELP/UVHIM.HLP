UVHIM
Type: Task
Use:  UVHIM produces an image of a two-dimensional histogram which
      summarizes the content of a uv data set.
Adverbs:
  INNAME......uv name,             Standard defaults.
  INCLASS.....uv class,            Standard defaults.
  INSEQ.......uv sequence number,  0 -> highest.
  INDISK......uv disk number,      0 -> any.
  SOURCES....List of sources to be plotted. '  '=> all; if any starts
             with a '-' then all except ANY source named.
  QUAL.......Qualifier of source to be plotted. -1 => all.
  CALCODE....Calibrator code of sources to plot. ' '=> all.
  STOKES.....The desired Stokes type of the plotted data:
               'I','Q','U','V','RR','LL','HALF','FULL'
             default usually FULL which will plot RR, LL, RL, and LR
             all added into the same plot.  Use 'HALF' or 'RRLL' or
             'I' to examine only parallel-hand data.
  SELBAND....Bandwidth of data to be selected. If more than one IF is
             present SELBAND is the width of the first IF required.
             Units = kHz.  For data which contain multiple bandwidths or
             frequencies the task will insist that some form of
             selection be made by frequency or bandwidth.
  SELFREQ....Frequency of data to be selected. If more than one IF is
             present SELFREQ is the frequency of the first IF required.
             Units = MHz.
  FREQID.....Frequency identifier to select (you may determine which is
             applicable from the OPTYPE='SCAN' listing produced by
             LISTR). If either SELBAND or SELFREQ are set, their values
             overide that of FREQID.  However, setting SELBAND and
             SELFREQ may result in an ambiguity.  In that case, the task
             will request that you use FREQID.  If all SELBAND, SELFREQ
             and FREQID are not specified (<= 0) then the task will loop
             over the frequency ID plotting all of them!
  TIMERANG...Time range of the data to be plotted. In order:
             Start day, hour, min. sec, end day, hour, min. sec.
             Days relative to reference date.
  ANTENNAS...A list of the antennas to plot.  If any number is negative
             then all antennas listed  are NOT desired and all others
             are.   All 0 => list all.
  BASELINE...Baselines are specified using BASELINE.
             Eg. for baselines 1-6,1-8, 2-6 and 2-8
             use ANTENNAS=1,2; BASELINE=6,8.
  UVRANGE....Range of projected spacings to be plotted in 1000's of
             wavelengths.  0  =>  1, 1.E10
  SUBARRAY...Subarray number to plot.        0 => all - the task will
             loop over subarray number.
  BCHAN......Beginning spectral line channel number.   0 => 1.
  ECHAN......Ending spectral line channel number.   0 => max.
  CHINC......Increment in spectral line channel number.   0 => 1.
  BIF........First IF number to plot.              0 => 1
  EIF........Last IF number to plot.               0 => highest
  DOCALIB....If true (>0), calibrate the data using information in the
             specified Cal (CL) table for multi-source or SN table for
             single-source data.  Also calibrate the weights unless
             DOCALIB > 99 (use this for old non-physical weights).
  GAINUSE....Version number of the Cal. table to apply to the data if
             DOCALIB=1.  Refers to a CL table for multi-source data or
             an SN table for single-source.  0 => highest.
  DOPOL......If > 0 then correct data for instrumental polarization as
             represented in the AN or PD table.  This correction is
             only useful if PCAL has been run or feed polarization
             parameters have been otherwise obtained.  See HELP DOPOL
             for available correction modes: 1 is normal, 2 and 3 are
             for VLBI.  1-3 use a PD table if available; 6, 7, 8 are
             the same but use the AN (continuum solution) even if a PD
             table is present.
  PDVER......PD table to apply if PCAL was run with SPECTRAL true and
             0 < DOPOL < 6.  <= 0 => highest.
  BLVER......Version number of the baseline based calibration (BL) table
             to apply. <0 => apply no BL table, 0 => highest, if any.
  FLAGVER....Specifies the version of the flagging table to be applied.
             0 => highest numbered table.  <0 => no flagging to be
             applied.
  DOBAND.....(multi-source) If true (>0), then correct the data for the
             shape of the antenna bandpasses using the BP table
             specified by BPVER.  The correction has five modes:
             (a) if DOBAND=1 all entries for an antenna in the table
             are averaged together before correcting the data.
             (b) if DOBAND=2 the entry nearest in time (including
             solution weights) is used to correct the data.
             (c) if DOBAND=3 the table entries are interpolated in
             time (using solution weights) and the data are then
             corrected.
             (d) if DOBAND=4 the entry nearest in time (ignoring
             solution weights) is used to correct the data.
             (e) if DOBAND=5 the table entries are interpolated in
             time (ignoring solution weights) and the data are then
             corrected.
  BPVER......(multi-source) specifies the version of the BP table to be
             applied. 0 => highest numbered table.
  SMOOTH.....Specifies the type of spectral smoothing to be applied to
             a uv database . The default is not to apply any smoothing.
             The elements of SMOOTH are as follows:
             SMOOTH(1) = type of smoothing to apply: 0 => no smoothing
               To smooth before applying bandpass calibration
                 1 => Hanning, 2 => Gaussian, 3 => Boxcar, 4 => Sinc
               To smooth after applying bandpass calibration
                 5 => Hanning, 6 => Gaussian, 7 => Boxcar, 8 => Sinc
             SMOOTH(2) = the "diameter" of the function, i.e. width
               between first nulls of Hanning triangle and sinc
               function, FWHM of Gaussian, width of Boxcar. Defaults
               (if < 0.1) are 4, 2, 2 and 3 channels for SMOOTH(1) =
               1 - 4 and 5 - 8, resp.
             SMOOTH(3) = the diameter over which the convolving
               function has value - in channels.  Defaults: 1,3,1,4
               times SMOOTH(2) used when input SMOOTH(3) < net
               SMOOTH(2).
  OUTNAME.....The output image name; standard defaults.
  OUTCLASS....The output image class; standard defaults.
  OUTSEQ......The output image seq. #.  0 => highest unique.
  OUTDISK.....The output disk drive no. 0 => highest with space.
  IMSIZE......Output image size in pixels: 0 => 256.
  BPARM.......Control paramaters
              (1) Code for parameter along X axis
              (2) Code for parameter on Y axis: choices are
                  1: visibility real part

                  6: time
                  7: baseline length [sqrt (u*u+v*v)]
                  8: baseline position angle
                  9: u
                 10: v
                 11: w
                 12: v - but in u-v plots, plot both hermitian points
              (3) > 0 => Fixed scale or range on X and Y axes
              (4,5) X axis min, max: if BPARM(4)<BPARM(5) then
                  use fixed scale, if BPARM(4)>BPARM(5) then use self
                  scale but not outside the range BPARM(5) to BPARM(4)
                  and if BPARM(4)=BPARM(5) then self scale
              (6,7) Y axis min, max: if BPARM(6)<BPARM(7) then
                  use fixed scale, if BPARM(6)>BPARM(7) then use self
                  scale but not outside the range BPARM(7) to BPARM(6)
                  and if BPARM(6)=BPARM(7) then self scale.
              (8) Support radius in pixels over which a sample is
                  counted.  0 -> 0.5
